my 3rd time watching this movie  yet  it still stunned my mind  kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward for someone like me  who ve rarely slept without dream  it s so exciting watching how christopher nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen  as it s been done so sophisticatedly  i do believe the rumour that nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of inception  in my opinion  it s been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer director career  i jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of nolan s remarkable works memento  as his first signature in the cinema history  is tremendous and has stayed the most mind bending film i ve ever seen  but overall  it doesn t reach the same level of inception the prestige is highly impressive but somehow i haven t been able to find the very particular  nolan s spirit  in it the batman trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak the dark knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well  nonetheless  every time we talk about it  heath ledger takes all the spotlights with his life time role  the  unique and only  joker then there came inception where nolan truly stood out  having every single detail of his work done in the finest way  the multi layered storyline despite its complexity  remains consistent and originally interesting  from visual aspect  everything was masterly handled  an impeccable cross cutting allowed the movie to follow nolan s nonlinear story telling without being scattered  a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes  some of them  i believe  will stay in the audience s mind for a long time  city bending in paris  zero gravity fight  in limbo  dreams collapsing      in addition  nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages later  we had interstellar  though i did admire its cinematography and visual effects  the film itself is nowhere near the level of inception spoilers ahead       for all who haven t watched this movie  you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers it is set in the world where there s technology that allows people to literally share dream  there is  in this world  a new kind of corporate spy    extractors  who use this technology to infiltrate the target s subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world  our hero mr cobb  leonardo dicaprio   a very well known extractor  and his partner arthur  joseph gordon levitt  are approached by a powerful businessman   mr saito  ken watanabe  for a nearly impossible mission  something no one has ever done before   instead of stealing  he wants them to plant an idea in a person s subconscious  which is also called  inception   in return  saito offers something that cobb could never resist  a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him  so cobb and arthur gather a team to carry out the mission  eames  tom hardy    a veteran identity forger  yusuf   the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3 levels  dream within a dream   and ariadne  ellen page    a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission  the target is robert fischer  cillian murphy    son and heir of saito s biggest competitor  maurice fischer  who s dying   the goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father s business  and the team has to carry saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception  while the team go deeper and deeper into fischer s mind  we discover gradually the dark of cobb s past  as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero  why he has became such an expert of inception and what is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission the movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly  about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life  in cobb s case  it s the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife mal  marion cotillard  and his regrets  so as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife  it will keep coming back and haunt his present  the deeper the team go into dream  the more dangerous his subconscious  under the form of his ghostly wife  comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission  indeed  if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story  the ending scene makes perfect sense  yes  we re now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history  did cobb find mr saito in limbo  bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world  or they are still stuck in limbo   the infinite dream world  and the last scene was just his big dream  but all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story  the result of inception mission  when we perceive the story in its deeper layer  as a journey for cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re find the meaning of his life  this ending did fulfill its job  cobb didn t even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn t care any more  what s important to him is that he gonna be with his kids  he did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on  and that matters  and after all  dream or reality  the importance is to truly live  so from this point of view  he has solved the maze of his life some short lines about the cast leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in shutter island and blood diamond joseph gordon levitt could have been more intense  given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie  zero gravity sequence  there was something missing in ken watanabe s performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission  maybe it was his english   tom hardy was ok but forgettable because his character didn t have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time ellen page was really impressive  she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect  and personally  i did find a lot of charms in her acting cillian murphy has also done a great job  much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission  his character robert fischer  at the end  was not so different than our hero cobb  they both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze  if for cobb  it was the painful past with his late wife  for fischer  it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad last but not least  the one who impressed me the most was marion  mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way  mostly with her speaking eyes  and for me  she is the most remarkable character of the movie,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9954911470413208, 'elapsed_time':

"you only get to watch this for the first time once  so choose your state of mind carefully 
it is a film about movies and dreams and reality  and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter 
it is spectacular  and brutal  and enigmatic and disturbing 
it is beautiful and absorbing 
it is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen 
i don t see it often  in case it s not as good as i like to remember it 
that is my secret  that i lock away in my safe in the basement 
that somewhere there is a perfect world for us all 
for some  perhaps it is in the cinema watching this","{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9939969182014465, 'elapsed_time': 0.14618992805480957}",positive

what is the most resilient parasite  an idea  yes  nolan has created something with his unbelievably  incredibly and god  gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away  the world premiere of the movie  directed by hollywood s most inventive dreamers  was shown in london and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points  now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this dom cobb di caprio  is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas  cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill  though he s increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife  mal  marion cotillard   who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions  cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love but then  as fate had decided  a wealthy business man saito  ken watanabe  hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival robert fischer jr  cillian murphy   but this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one   inception then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition  to carry out the the task  cobb s  brainiac  specialists team up again with him  arthur  joseph gordon levitt   his longtime organizer  tom hardy  eames   a  forger  who can shapeshift at will  and yusuf  dileep rao   a powerful sedative supplier there is only one word to describe the cinematography  the set designs and the special effects  and that is exceptional  you don t just watch the scenes happening  you feel them  the movie is a real thrill ride  the action scenes are well picturised and the music by hans zimmer is electronically haunting  never  in the runtime of the movie  you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object leonardo  who is still popularly known for jack dawson played by him in titanic  should be relieved as his role as dom cobb will be remembered forever  his performance may or may not fetch him an oscar but it will be his finest performance till date  the supporting cast too did an extraordinary work  christopher nolan  ah  what a man he is  his work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the  best director  category  if  inception  is a metaphysical puzzle  it s also a metaphorical one  it s hard not to draw connections between cobb s dream weaving and nolan s film making  intended to seduce us  mess with our heads and leave an ever lasting impression to conclude  i would just say before your life ends  do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by nolan my rating  10 10thanks   regards,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9928057789802551, 'elapsed_time': 0.14232850074768066}",positive

films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird   inception  is no exception to that rule  but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion  i e   the matrix   1999    the cell   2000    abre los ojos   1997    its american remake  vanilla sky   2001    you really can t look away  nor should you  inception  is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype  it is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll  the less you know about this movie going in  the more you will be entranced by seeing it leonardo dicaprio plays dom cobb  a world class criminal who  with the help of a team of sleep experts  works his way into people s subconscious and steals what people value most  ideas directly from their minds  in his last assignment to possibly clear his name  he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone  but to plant one inside that person s mind  the difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken that plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story  but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe  dicaprio is good in his role  but unlike many other films he has starred in  this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co star  instead  this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work  just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist  joseph gordon levitt  ellen page  and tom hardy are especially good in their roles the special effects in this film were also very good  which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the  matrix  movies  there are slow motion shots  but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences  it s especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams  and impossible sequences are filmed in a way i ve never seen other than in drawings however  the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn t good  for this reason  even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film  the credit here can be given to writer and director christopher nolan  who has not made a bad film yet  there are many twists and turns in this film  but nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story  if nolan does not get nominated for best director and or best original screenplay next oscar season  there is something terribly wrong with the academy that being said  there was still a lot about this film i still don t get  and may require multiple viewings to better understand  however  some of the best films i ve seen are confusing at first   2001  a space odyssey   1968  is a film i ve seen a couple of times  and still don t understand completely  it still has a major following  though  as i m positive this movie will  it s an incredibly entertaining movie  but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9932698011398315, 'elapsed_time': 0.14055848121643066}",positive
this review is being written by a 46 year old guy  i mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important  as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more  and can take the fast paced action and frenetic pace  i assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film  just something to consider as you read this as for the movie  i ll be up front about the fact that i did not love this film  it s just not the sort of movie i d usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go  i am glad i did  however  as i really could respect the movie in many ways  first  the story is wildly original  though  also quite confusing   other than the matrix films  i can t think of anything that even comes close to it in style  second  the production looked and sounded great  the music was intense and worked great with the amazing  totally amazing  special effects  third  it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are not light weights and could act  leonardo dicaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in  titanic   his maturity and grit were welcome  also  seeing the kid from  third rock  suddenly playing an action hero was great  you d barely recognize him  or the other grown child actors  fourth  i loved the ending  it really pulled everything together very well so why am i not giving the film a glowing review  well  i am simply not an action film fan  and  the insane pace  tons of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times  i much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film  also  while ken watanabe is a fine actor  i had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he said  to the point where i wish they d either dubbed him or had caption  now this is not just because i am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearing  my daughter  too  found his thick accent difficult  on the other hand  ms  cotillard was very easy to understand and i was surprised how well she controlled her lovely french accent i could probably go on and on about the film  as it s long  complex and very prone to be one to watch and re watch and discuss with friends  however  at this point  there are already a bazillion reviews and 7 billion people have already gone to see it  so i ll call it a day well worth seeing    but perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9888792634010315, 'elapsed_time': 0.15316176414489746}",positive

inception is as original as you can get with a sci fi movie  i feel like it s kind of pointless to compare this to blade runner  aliens  terminator 2  2001  a space odyssey or any other sci fi blockbusters  for they re completely different  what nolan crafted is genius  in my mind he is still yet to make a bad movie  it is now time to get into spoiler territory inception is a story about dreams  how you can build anything you want  nolan took 10 years to write the screenplay and it was definitely worth while  this is one of the most mind blowing  nail biting  epic action packed science fiction movies of all time  all the performances in this film are amazing  the special effects are flawless  the acting is flawless  the story is flawless  the writing is flawless  this is one of a few pictures that just got everything right in all categories  most people saw there is no such thing as a flawless movie and i would 100  love to disagree with them there  all of the christopher nolan movies i have seen so far have no real flaws  leonardo dicaprio christopher nolan  pure gold  these two should definitely collaborate more  inception just proves that chris is a cinematic god  from his screenplays  to his production  to his film direction  everything is perfect you have to imagine it to believe it  watching it once isn t enough  watching it twice isn t enough  you have got to watch this 10 times or even more to really get the true essence of why this movie is considered to be one of the greatest of all time  it is truly film making at it s greatest  it is one of the most re watch able movies a director has ever put out  it s like dark knight  memento and most of his other work where immediately after you watch it you feel like watching it again at times it gets confusing because sometimes it feels like it s the real world when it is actually the dream world and leonardo dicaprio s performance  oh my god  in my opinion it is his greatest performance  and inception should have won best picture  fun fact  this film got nominated for best screenplay and many other oscar nominations  yet they don t nominate the man who put it all together who directed the gosh darn masterpiece i watch this film at least twice a week and to see that watchmojo put social network higher than inception on their top 10 movies of the decade list p sses me off  yeah  it s david fincher  i get that watchmojo love david fincher  but higher than inception  nah if anybody else directed this it would be an average  unoriginal and completely unimaginative piece of work  when nolan gets his hands on something it is always going to be original  classic and everything great about movies  i d place this on my top 5 films of the century list  most films on that list would include nolan films because he is the best director working today and you have to accept that more will be added soon,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9931873679161072, 'elapsed_time': 0.14014625549316406}",positive
inception is written  produced  and directed by christopher nolan  the film stars leonardo dicaprio  ken watanabe  joseph gordon levitt  marion cotillard  ellen page  tom hardy  cillian murphy  dileep rao  tom berenger  and michael caine  the musical score is by hans zimmer and wally pfister is the cinematographer  plot finds dicaprio playing dom cobb  a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people  but one day he gets a different offer  one that will enable him to see his estranged children  to get his reward he must enact inception  the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target  but inception is thought impossible and should cobb and his selected team fail  the consequences are unthinkable there has already been much written and pondered about as regards inception in the relatively short running time of its life  one can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time  for although it s arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of 2001  a space odyssey  it s inescapable that nolan s movie is this current generation s sci fi classic  that nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream  and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process  is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanship inception is a film that it s better to know nothing about before venturing into it  and then it asks  well nolan asks  for your undivided attention  it s neither as confusing as some have painted it  nor does it have any tricks peek behind the curtain type up its sleeve  the truth is is that inception has something for everyone  thematically speaking  and that s before we pore over the special effects that sees nolan raising the bar considerably  as is the case with twisty high concept movies  interpretations are many  with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie  what forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles  with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over  there s also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with  that of course wont work for everyone  but that is just one of many strands that nolan dangles for the discerning viewer if that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the super hero genre  rest assured thrill seekers  inception is also a loud swirly spectacle  the action is raucous  be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups  nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled roller coaster ride  aided superbly by lee smith s editing and pfister s perfectly broad photography while zimmer s score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains  ex smiths guitarist johnny marr on 12 string  to craft one of the best scores of 2010  as i said  there s something for everyone here  making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbuster then there s the strong ensemble cast  led by a quite scintillating performance from dicaprio  following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in shutter island  dicaprio has given 2010 two of its best lead performances  here he gives real depth of emotion  the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on  his unfussy acting is easy to buy into  giving the character the air of believability  he is the glue that binds the whole film together  murphy is wonderfully vulnerable  very much an axis in the narrative  while levitt almost usurps dicaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it  special praise  too  for ellen page  still in her early 20s  she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress  hands  while hardy provides brawny levity and berenger leaves a favourable mark the matrix meets heat and mission impossible  only it s written by phillip k  dick and richard matheson  or something like that  a cracking hybrid movie that s fit to grace any summer and sure to improve and enlighten with further viewings  9 5 10,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9988247156143188, 'elapsed_time': 0.14354944229125977}",positive
i d like to keep my review rather to the point pros  1  its theme   dream is a fascinating topic to say the least  there are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld 2  its plot   there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns 3  its edgy drive   although you know what s coming next  still you feel jumpy about it when it does 4  its rapid storyline   the story moves fast from one scene to another  making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride  at times  it s hard to keep up  even after watching it several times 5  its sophistication   there is a lot of information to remember and digest  this is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after  i believe 6  its realism   okay  pun intended  the movie explains  or at least tries to  the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions  some of which are very familiar with and dear to us cons  1  its poor character development   although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development  i wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character s  after watching the movie  yes  the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else  if you ask me 2  too many distractions   i found that the movie had more characters than necessary  they may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else  i wish the movie was more focused 3  a bit preachy   i noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie  i m afraid  inception overused this trick in conclusion  its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement i highly recommend you to go and read somewhere carnal over 40 winks  if you dig this kind of flicks cheers,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9081063270568848, 'elapsed_time': 0.14207148551940918}",positive
what do we ask for in a summer blockbuster  what is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out  epic hugeness  blowing stuff up  romance  action  heroes  what are we looking for in a blockbuster  i think it all boils down to thrills  audiences want the thrill of a car chase  the thrill of romance  the thrill of the spectacular  if that is the case  then inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don t look for   brains   what is the most resilient parasite  an idea  says leonardo di caprio s character cobb  well  inception is all about ideas  it s all right there in the title  the film central idea revolves around  extractors   who are paid to extract secrets from people s subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams  usually for the purpose of corporate espionage  however  when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival   inception  is born  the less said about this film the better  it is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece i divulge  a piece of the film s genius is weakened  this is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost  such is the power of christopher nolan s script which  i imagine  is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction  but everything that makes this film so great is in the script   in the ideas  everything else is just spectacle  this film bears an uncanny resemblance  thematically  with dicaprio s other instant classic this year  shutter island  both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual  both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality  however  inception is an even more layered film than shutter island and i believe the sci fi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of scorsese s film  there is not a single dull moment in nolan s film  there is style  charm and intelligence in every frame of the film  every performance is pitch perfect with some strong support by ellen page and joseph gordon levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars  leonardo dicaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled  grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world  the best part of inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera  while the film does make use of cgi  there are some pretty mind blowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies  a rare treat these days  this is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes  smart  sexy  femme fatale  sexy brainy girl  very beautiful men in very beautiful suits  and magical  inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die  because anyone who thinks it s ok to watch this film on a laptop or ipad is a fool  this is pure cinema  and proud of it  not to be missed on the big screen,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9943222403526306, 'elapsed_time': 0.14070558547973633}",positive

the film is a disappointment  because it did so little with so much  basically what you have here is a very interesting sci fi heist premise  cobb  leonardo dicaprio  and arthur  joseph gordon levitt  are partners who use dream invasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers  why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit  is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise  while they doze  in exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against cobb  they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission  to practice  inception  on a powerful business scion  that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulation all of this is great  but unfortunately none of it has any emotional weight  to find that we have to look into the mystery of why cobb has been in exile  and this plot has to do with his wife  marion cotillard  with whom he shared a disastrous and traumatic experience of dream sharing  this is to me where the movie essentially falls apart  it seems like nolan and the other writers never fully synthesized these two dominant strains in the film  so that most of the time the emotional drama is just getting in the way of the heist film or vice a versa  at no point did it seem to me that the heist was complimenting the drama or vice a versa  and in fact after some very impressive effects sequences during the scenes where cobb shows his new assistant ariadne  ellen page  too green to hold up her role  a lot of the action becomes outright tedious  never more so than when we re  treated  to about a reel or ten minutes of numbing snow mobile and gunfight action  right at the point where the film should be reaching a climax  it all starts to feel very obligatory  and nolan is not a good enough action director to make empty content feel like fun as a basic action heist movie with sci fi premise  it still works well enough that i would recommend it as a rental  nolan works in some of the elements that have made some of his better films work on a higher level  such as the association with totems and icons  the spinning wheel  etc   and the connection between memory or memory devices and identity  however when all the pieces are laid out  the film seems overly simple and mechanical  the plot is just this    the guy takes a job  he does the job  he gets to re unite with his kids  although he constantly mopes about in a depression because he tried inception on his wife and she died  he has no ethical or moral problem with doing the same thing to cillian murphy s character  even though nobody knows the real consequences that could befall or the true motives of ken watanabe s character  i was hoping that some larger picture would emerge  but instead this film is politically naive and instead attempts to be dramatic  the constant shots of adorable children playing on the lawn made me feel i was watching a bad spielberg film  the entire emotional anchor of the film is put on the shoulders of these cute kiddies in true spielberg fashion  if you don t buy into this ridiculous soft target hook  then the whole film collapses like dicaprio s dream world this isn t a bad or stupid film  but after a while you start to yearn for at least some human warmth or humor  which is almost always missing from nolan s films  the characters are so sincere that it starts to become suffocating  especially considering how ridiculous the premise is when taken seriously  basically this is like  total recall  in terms of ideas and in terms of stupid action scenes  except that it takes itself hugely seriously  it does not become a better film by doing so  nor a more intelligent one,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.03447195515036583, 'elapsed_time': 0.20678234100341797}",negative
the central idea of  inception  is an interesting one  technology exists to enter other people s dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas  with christopher nolan of  memento  fame as writer and director  this should have been a smart  compelling movie  unfortunately   inception  is a bloated failure the root problem is that nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from james bond movies  for example  early in the film  when cobb and ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world  cobb tells ariadne to stay calm  what s going to happen  is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs  is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with abraham lincoln  no  things start exploding  and that s the whole movie in a nutshell  gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas the matryoshka doll plot of dreams within dreams isn t nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine  this is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels  the higher level supporting actors just fight off bad guys    and overblown special effects    until it s time to bring back their colleagues from the depths nolan should sit back  watch a few of the best movies by luis bunuel and david lynch  and try again with one tenth the budget and ten times the imagination   okay  that s never gonna happen  but it s  my  dream,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.049360230565071106, 'elapsed_time': 0.22391295433044434}",negative
i have been reading nothing but good reviews on inception these past few weeks  now i knew from the minute i saw the trailer  i had to see this movie but i didn t know what to expect  if you have seen the trailer to this movie  you know that it doesn t explain too much  but i saw inception today and all i can say is  wow  with an incredible cast and amazing director  you just can t go wrong  inception is a movie that not only makes you think but can start a whole conversation with what you just saw on the screen  it s a very clever story that is told with skill and passion  while you do have to pay attention  i loved that it made me think  one of my friends saw a premiere and told me how he would have to see it again to understand it  but i didn t get that when i saw it today  but i would love to see the movie again  i have no problem with that  between the performances  the story  the sounds  the editing and the incredible effects  i would love to watch this movie over and over again  it s my favorite film of the year so far dom cobb is a skilled thief  the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction  stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state  when the mind is at its most vulnerable  cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage  but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved  now cobb is being offered a chance at redemption  one last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible inception  he gathers a group of thieves that will pull this incredible mission off  teaching new comer  ariadne their amazing world and how to alter it to their liking  but if gone too deep into making the dream into something strange  they could get lost and play limbo between reality and dreams  even after all the lessons  instead of the perfect heist  cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse  their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one to write a dream is a riddle  i love the way this movie was written  christopher nolan is one of my new favorite directors  he knows exactly how to write and tell a story  the only small flaw  this is a very small complaint  is that his stories while they re incredible  can also be a bit exhausting  this film is a bit long to warn you in advance  it s a little over two and a half hours long  i felt like there were a couple of things with the story that could have been trimmed  but like i said it s such a small complaint because inception intrigued me so much  to say that this film will be a contender for the oscars is pretty much a guarantee with the sound  script  editing and effects  hopefully i think it might be a runner up for best picture one of the things i hate to do in a review is brag about a movie because i don t want others to get over hyped with the film and to be disappointed when they see it  but honestly  i don t think there isn t one person i wouldn t recommend this movie too  inception has some of the most incredible effects mixing the matrix and the dark knight  i think the  zero gravity  fight scene is one of the most amazing moments i ve seen on the big screen  i loved how the story kept you thinking and going  guessing what would happen next and what was going on  a dream within a dream within a dream  you even begin to question with the characters what is a dream and what is reality  with a great cast and excellent director  inception is everything i wanted and more  once again  nolan created a masterpiece  something from his own mind  inception questions yours  and makes you wonder which world you are part of 10 10,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9981944561004639, 'elapsed_time': 0.23377585411071777}",positive
i have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film  takes some doing here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film  you have great special effects  a sci fi conundrum  beautiful visuals and good sound  yet the most important part of the film is missing  there is no plot  character or soul to this film  it s like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside it s an empty shell of a film  there is no tension  you couldn t care less about any of the characters  why were they even motivated to do what they did  helping a corporation get  one over  on another corporation is hardly saving the human race when you operate in a dream environment  where you can t die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about  who cares what happens  all the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless  by the way  why does hollywood still keep filming action scene s an inch away from every characters nose  it s impossible to see what s going on  so many films are ruined by this  watch and learn from the matrix  take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what s going on so 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending  is a million miles from being a good film  how anyone in their right mind can give this 10 10  it s boring and pointless  a film has stir the soul  has to grab you  you need to feel for the characters  can anyone  honestly say  they cared about anyone on show here by the way  here s an idea  why don t you bring the children  who haven t aged a minutes since you last saw them  to you  if you can t go to the us i know the end scene was trying to be ambiguous  but the fact his father  who lives in paris  is bizarrely there in the us to meet him  how did he know  and the children look identical to every dream sequence they appeared in  means there wasn t much doubt in the end there is nothing at stake for anyone  so a pointless movie  i suspect nolan will continue to get praise  but i can t really say i ve got excited about any of his movies  they all leave me cold  they are not terrible  just there s nothing really there  no substance,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.003476473968476057, 'elapsed_time': 0.21700239181518555}",negative
the reality is that my summary basically sums up this movie  it has you questioning reality all the way through  in some ways similar to the matrix  i suppose  although it s more obvious in this movie that there s questioning about reality to be done  this movie  however  lacks the philosophical religious elements that the matrix had  and stands as a pretty formulaic action type movie with the issues about reality thrown in essentially  this movie takes place within a dream   or within dreams to be more precise  that s the catch  leonardo dicaprio as cobb plays a man who has somehow figured out not only how to get into people s dreams but how to link various people into the same dream  so that the dream becomes reality  some tragedy has befallen cobb as a result of this  which is finally revealed  but it does take a while  cobb and his team are hired by a japanese businessman who wants them to get inside the dreams of one of his corporate rivals to convince him to break his company up  thus eliminating the rivalry  the move goes from there it s a confusing movie  there aren t just two layers to it   reality and dream  there are actually multiple layers of various kinds of reality  as characters can enter into dreams within dreams  each successive layer becoming more and more removed from what reality really is   if you get the point  it s imaginative  but it is confusing as you try to sort the layers out  in all honesty  it s not a movie that especially appealed to me  dicaprio s performance was good but nothing more and there were some really good special effects included in this  aside from the dream inside a dream inside a dream gimmick  though  this stacks up as an action movie among action movies  and i didn t find it an especially noteworthy addition to the genre  a friend told me it s the sort of movie you have to watch 2 or 3 times to really get your head around it  i think i have a reasonable enough attention span  and if i can t get my head around a movie on the first watching  then it s unlikely i m going to go back to it again i will say that this is the sort of movie that s tailor made to produce sequels  the very last scene leaves everything wide open to continue exploring whether or not cobb is actually back in reality   remember  the top was still spinning on the table as the last scene faded out   the possibilities for sequels are virtually limitless  everything is based on a dream or dreams  you could have anything from comedy to action to historical epic to outer space adventure and it would all make sense  because it s all a dream or dreams  still  while i can have some appreciation for the ingenuity of the writers to come up with a story that has the potential to literally go on forever  i didn t find enough here to make me want to look at the inevitable sequels,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9757072925567627, 'elapsed_time': 0.20750093460083008}",positive
i cannot ignore facts  i cannot ignore mistakes and plot holes  bad writing  or bad marketing  i cannot ignore hype  especially when it s already on the imdb top 250  it received praise from critics  cashed in a lot of money  and people call it stunning and unforgettable  the simple truth is that inception does not live up to the hype  let me start with the trailer  all the coolest things  the folding city  the collapsing cliffs  the train in the street  are totally unessential to the plot  none of that takes more than a few seconds  so why did they put them on all the posters as well  nevermind  i ll move on to the real problems of the movie so i heard all these people saying how complex the movie is  how i ll need to watch it twice  how the shocking ending will blow my mind  i knew exactly what that  shocking ending  would be half way through the film  the very last paragraph of this review deals with the ending  it s not exactly a spoiler but you can skip it if you don t want to know anything cobb  dicaprio  takes on a mission to implant a thought into fischer s  murphy  mind  as a reward  his contractor saito  watanabe  will clean his record with the lapd  cobb is wanted for the murder of his wife and consequently he can t return to usa and see his children  throughout the movie  this is cobb s main inner conflict  that before he fled the country  he didn t get a chance to see the kids  faces and he wants to see them again  michael cain has a very small role as their grandpa and dicaprio s father in law  why doesn t cain take the kids someplace so they could be with their father  people move all the time  or why doesn t he send cobb some home movies if he wants to see their faces so much  they could even have video calls and all that stuff  it s a long distance relationship but it s something  well  apparently no one thought of that  and so the main character s main motivation for his actions makes no sense as for acting  dicaprio was good  but if you ve seen shutter island  you ve seen a third of inception  dead wife  small kids  a sense of loss  a pretty wooden house in a field  all those flashbacks teddy had in shutter island it s all in inception  minus the funny boston accent the mission these mind thieves embark on is to plant an idea into a rich guy s mind  this is called inception  hence the title  i guess  everyone says it s impossible to do  so you know they are going to succeed in the end  inception is essentially a heist movie  but instead of getting into a vault  cobb s team has to get inside someone s mind   which happens to look like a vault  the supposed complexity of the movie boils down to the idea of a dream within a dream  basically  imagine that once you are plugged inside the matrix  you plug yourself into yet another  deeper  matrix  there  i just explained the super complex plot of the movie  but in case that wasn t enough  there is ellen page s character  ariadne  she is the obligatory new member of the team that is introduced to represent the audience and their questions  i m fine with that  every movie has one of those uninitiated people  the thing is  she understands everything too quickly and becomes suddenly becomes the most competent character  pretty convenient  if you ask me let me finally get to the mission  it s the worst part of the movie  watanabe wants murphy  who just inherited a huge corporation  to dissolve it  because it was going to become a huge monopoly  so watanabe hires dicaprio to plant the idea of splitting the company in murphy s mind  and so they do that  for two and a half hours  but i don t care if he splits the big company or not  why should i care if murphy has a bigger company than watanabe  the stakes of the movie aren t high  they are nonexistent  i am not given any reason to care about whether or not they succeed  i m only given more and more action set pieces to look forward to  and a lot of cool slow motion and zero gravity fights reminiscent of the matrix  but i m not given any reason to care for what is happening  i liked watanabe s character only because i like ken watanbe  as for saito himself  i don t give a damn if his competitor destroys his company or not  they don t tell us what consequences it would have  they don t show us what happens with the company  they don t do anything with this initial idea  which is strange  because the movie is all about ideas being important okay  so i didn t like the plot and the acting was nothing new  what about the rest  hans zimmer s unremarkable score works well with the scenes but it would be super boring to hear on its own  the visual effects are good but since all the coolest city folding scenes were so short  there wasn t really that much to do  the zero gravity stuff was done well  i ll give them that  cinematography was good  bordering on too much shaky camera here s the paragraph about the ending the big ending is that you are supposed to be unsure what was a dream and what was reality  if it was real  then it s stupid because dicaprio had dozens of ways to be with his kids without making things so incredibly complicated  the movie is supposed to make you think  but if you think about it the whole plot falls apart  if it was a dream  then it s a stupid cop out on nolan s part  an excuse for all the things that didn t make sense  it was all a dream  so screw you  audience,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.005825654603540897, 'elapsed_time': 0.42052435874938965}",negative

many of us  not least those who populate the online world with movie reviews  observations and criticisms  are aware of chris nolan s raw talent  memento broke onto the screen a decade ago and provided us with a spectacle in story telling so rare that it dumbfounded us  since then  nolan has gained huge popularity with his revival of the batman franchise  and even more so with the stunning dark knight   that still has yet to relinquish its grip on modern day cinema   with the genius of the prestige sandwiched in between none of this  however  could have quite prepared us for the spectacle that is inception  a script that has been worked on for over a decade  nolan s endeavours are inescapable in its pure complexity and brilliance   quite simply  one of the best film story lines audiences will have encountered in their lifetime  all this is supplemented superbly by the film s ensemble cast   dicaprio s performance cannot easily be done justice without seeing it  with this and shutter island  now must be the time for his first oscar   he has asserted his place as truly one of the best actors currently working  all reviews will confirm that joseph gordon levitt  tom hardy and ellen page back his performance up superbly with well worked turns  inception s action sequences play out wonderfully  being   along with the comic relief and back stories   an integral part of the film s unravelling  whilst we remain rooted to the film s emotional stakes  which give immense purpose to the film s complex and layered narrative our protagonist battles with both outer and inner demons in his quest for redemption  the unique concept of entering dreams offers the opportunity not only for a unique species of heist but also a way to dig deeper and deeper into one s subconscious  and the ability to plant an idea which could define that person  or destroy them in theaters around the world  nolan uses his dynamic skill to plant an idea in our minds which together allows us to experience the very dream  share the film explores  one which will remain with us long after the film s emotional climax  inception is a cinema experience so audacious  so incredible  and in the end so gratifying  that it truly is unmissable  and will remain a benchmark for many filmmakers in years to come 10 10,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9990346431732178, 'elapsed_time': 0.4044535160064697}",positive
unless you call this movie a masterpiece  then you are damn 1 000 word limit  gotta make this quick spoilers the film is 2 5 hours long  yet feels like 5 2  and there are a few reasons for this  one of which is the fact that a preponderance of the first act is amateurish  conflict free exposition  which does not bode well for repeat viewings the  learning about the dream world  scene is atrocious  no conflict  both leo and page s characters already knew what was being explained  the similar  learning about the matrix  scene in the matrix did it right by having one character not know anything  plus  there was conflict  neo gets his ass kicked and fails to make the building jump  much more entertaining there s another problem with the whole section of bending the landscape where leo explains the negative aspects of altering the dream world  the closest we get to seeing the dream world altered was leo becoming mr  charlie  yet the most that happens then is a bunch of extras turn and look at leo  that s it  the idea was not exploited  you literally have to go out of your way to miss that opportunity  hell  that mr  charles scene is shorter than the scene that explains why altering the dream world is bad let s not forget this whole idea of one corporation one upping another has absolutely no personal ramifications for anyone on screen or in the audience  it would have greatly amped up the internal conflict if leo had to struggle with the notion that helping the guy who could help him would endanger someone else close to him  or us  or someone else  anything could have worked better than an energy contract that means less to me than my neighbor s bath mat  come on the totems were handled very poorly  all we need to know is their purpose  we don t need to know anything else  yet the film keeps piling on needless information if this is a heist film  where is the threat of being caught a van falls for an endless amount of time  joseph gordon levitt floats bodies down a hallway for half an hour  real time  the guy from bronson does his thing  whatever the hell that was  these are not complex tasks or events  but rather straight forward in nature  dragging them out for a solid chunk of the film is what creates the glacial pace and makes a long film seem even longer inception has no real villain  you can make a case for cotillard  but she is an internal enemy  she never takes a  physical  presence and never threatens anyone except leo  everyone else is dealing with faceless assassins  that makes it feel distant from the rest of the action  it doesn t even have anything to do  emotionally  with leo s goal of getting home to see his kids  none of this is tied together  leo didn t even know what the hell was going on with cillian and never even knew of the outcome until after the fact  he s separated from the physical manifestation of his goal for a majority of the film  i ended up not caring if the plan succeeded  if it was all somehow tied together  the audience would be able to experience that great emotional catharsis that everyone was talking about   but that didn t happen in fact  leo is so separated from the actual plot that you can literally put levitt in his place and not even need the hero in the dream world at all  hell  you can even put page there  since all she does after designing the boring and lifeless dream worlds is hang out with the guys and tell leo he s crazy  i really wish she had something else to do besides play the part of the fifth wheel leo s lack of involvement in the main action of the story creates a  so what   moment when the problem is solved for him  and i can think of absolutely no reason why the hero should not be the one to conquer the main conflict  brody kills the shark in jaws  he doesn t send hooper and quint out to do his dirty work while he stays behind to deal with his fear of water  it s integrated  the hero is forced into dealing with the physical  and in turn  but learn to conquer his internal fears before he can conquer his external opponent  this is screen writing 101  lesson 1  and nolan got that wrong  that s why i don t believe the reports that he spent 10 years writing the script since it only took me 148 minutes to figure out exactly what was wrong with it not to mention the conceit that to enter someone else s dream and control it means that you would have to control your own subconscious  which they state elsewhere is impossible  way to go  genius pretty much everything this film does wrong  the matrix does right  watch that instead ps  the  taking a scene from the middle and putting it at the beginning  gag reached its peak effectiveness in 2002 and has absolutely no place in modern films  it s getting as bad as that tired old  it s all a dream  scenario  oh  wait,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.0073021831922233105, 'elapsed_time': 0.34319067001342773}",negative

before leonardo dicaprio agreed to play the lead part in  inception   he spent months with christopher nolan trying to improve the script  it was at dicaprio s insistence that the part he was playing  cobb  the corporate dream extractor  had to have a more beefed up internal arc  otherwise  inception would turn out to be another shallow  action adventure thriller  despite cobb s triumph over his internal demons  particularly the way in which he expunges his dead wife  who has been haunting him in his subconscious   inception is much more an exploration of the mechanics of dreaming than a chronicle of emotional catharsis at the basic level  inception can be divided into four distinct parts  intro  exposition  journey and resolution  the intro consists of the initial scene  a flashback where cobb must save his employer  a sleazy japanese businessman  saito  now far advanced in years  who has been stuck in a limbo like purgatory for decades  unaware that he was mortally wounded in someone else s dream  it s a nice  little compact scene where we see a near dead cobb  washed up on a beach and dragged into saito s fortress compound  a gun is left on the table in front of saito and we re trying to figure out whether saito is going to kill cobb or himself cut to the next scene where cobb and his associate are involved in a trying to extract information from a much younger saito inside one of his dreams  as they all sleep on a bullet train somewhere in japan  apparently  saito was expecting the dream extractors and informs them that this is their  audition   the extractors   architect   the guy in charge of designing the dreamworld  somehow lets things get out of control when a mob of men invade the room where they re all staying  and saito later has his thugs toss the architect off the roof of a heliport  despite the botched job  saito is impressed that cobb and his partner are able to move through different  levels  in the dreamworld  cobb s  audition  could have been compressed into one or two minutes but nolan insists on illustrating every aspect of his convoluted plot  we finally arrive at the film s inciting incident  saito s proposal to cobb that he enter the dream world of his business rival  fischer  and plant a suggestion in his subconscious  leading to the dissolution of the rival s entire business empire   inception  is the reverse of what cobb and his team have been trained to do extracting information and cobb has doubts about successfully carrying out saito s proposal  but when saito promises to pull some strings  enabling cobb to return to the united states  despite murder charges hanging over his head  cobb can t resist jumping at the chance to see his two children again the next part of  inception   the  exposition   takes about an hour  this is where cobb assembles his new carefully selected  mission impossible  superstar team who will penetrate fischer s mind and plant the suggestion to break up his dying father s business empire  nolan s explanation of the mechanics of the dreamworld is so complicated  that he has cobb explain it to his new architect  a naive graduate student who manages to acquit herself rather well despite facing major obstacles inside multiple dreamworlds  nolan manages to violate a major tenet of screen writing technique  show don t tell  unfortunately  during these expository sequences  there s a lot more  tell  than  show   yes  there is a rather neat scene  reminiscent of an m  c  escher illustration   where one paris landscape folds on top of another but most of the visuals are much more mundane  for example  a speeding locomotive appears out of nowhere during a car chase on a paris street much has been written about the  journey  aspect of  inception   critics seem to be impressed by the three dreamworlds the  dream team  penetrates  coupled with the way in which they re able to return to reality the so called  kicks   where a huge sound or explosion propels them through the different levels back up to the surface  nolan  however  serves up some of the dullest and derivative landscapes that our  heroes  must navigate through in fact  these so called dreams don t look like dreams at all  take level 1 just a typical shoot em up with faceless bad guys chasing the  good guys   as for level 2 i felt i was watching a parody of space odyssey  with our dreamers floating through a hotel without the benefit of gravity  finally  i have heard  level 3   compared to  ice station zebra   the schlocky 60s action film set in the arctic inception s resolution is as unsatisfying as the earlier parts of the film  what are we to make of cobb  just because he has made this deal with saito and it enables him to see his children  does not mitigate the fact that the whole plan to literally change fischer s mind  is reprehensible  after all  shouldn t have cobb walked away when saito had his men murder the first architect  cobb  by and large  remains a tainted and unsympathetic character  precisely because he looks the other way when he s quite aware that saito has committed murder we re also told  by saito  that the breakup of fischer s empire is a good thing but should we take his word for it  he s a thug and nolan has provided us nothing to go on to evaluate the nature of the fischer empire  finally  why does fischer cry at his father s deathbed  he s just learned that his father put his mother in a mental institution so shouldn t he be angry  or are those tears of joy so that he can be now  his own man  the bulk of  inception  is merely a pastiche of mediocre action adventure espionage thrillers dating back to the 60s when the genre was in full bloom  the long winded  b  story  cobb s tortured machinations in trying to literally kick his dead wife out of his subconscious mind  merely serves to distract us from the hollowness of the overall plot,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.31564247608184814, 'elapsed_time':

its all flash and little substance in christopher nolan s over long story of people able to go into the dreams of others i m not going to go into the plot  partly to play fair with those of you who haven t see the film  but nolan has constructed a film so needlessly messy that its damn near impossible to summarize simply yes the visuals are spectacular  though most of them are obviously cgi creations  there are also fewer than you would think since the dream weavers of the story have to keep thing real in order to achieve their ends for me the story isn t much of anything certainly not enough to support a two and a half hour tale  the deepness of nolan s  philosophy  is also over done  and ultimately meaningless since nolan is on record as saying it s all been made up and exists purely to drive his plot i like the story i just wish it didn t take so long to get where it was going i also hate that nolan changes the rules about half way in as a means of making things more exciting  its not fair and i was so annoyed i walked out of the theater the first time i saw the film good not great  its worth a look see down the road,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6962299346923828, 'elapsed_time': 0.24419069290161133}",positive
cobb is a extractor  he enters the minds of powerful people and takes their ideas  only his latest case is not as simple  instead of taking an idea  he must implant one  however cobb is a man whose own sub conscience is in disarray as his dead wife threatens to destroy him i thought originally when i watched the trailer    interesting   but i ve seen this somewhere before  and then as i watched the film it hit me   paprika    paprika is a anime were a therapist enters the minds of patients to distinguish the problem i am not saying that the film is a complete copy  because its not   however  the complexity of the film is quite confusing at times  even for a life long sci fi fan  i guess that was the allure when you consider the many  many positive and glowing reviews  i enjoyed some of the action sequences  but it did not really keep me on the edge of my seat  cillian murphy and ken wattanbe  were the true stars in my opinion  they played their roles very well  while leonardo dicaprio was one dimensional  even though he was supposed to be the most complex and intriguing character in the film,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9852466583251953, 'elapsed_time': 0.26551055908203125}",positive

inception is a beautiful and unpredictable masterpiece directed by my favorite director  christopher nolan  inception is an epic  intellectual  and thought provoking action film with an ensemble cast featuring acknowledged actors such as oscar winner michael caine and oscar nominated leonardo dicaprio  ken watanabe  and tom hardy  the movie was released in 2010 but is still widely talked about to this day leonardo dicaprio plays a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets  this makes him one of the most wanted men in the world of espionage  they call him the idea extractor  but this time he is trying something completely different  he is going to plant an idea in the subconscious of the target  not extracting information i love the concept of this movie  dreams are a complex subject that we know very little about  a few years ago  i was introduced to the idea of lucid dreaming  and i practice it from time to time  i have a huge interest in dreams and inception depicts dreaming like no other movie i have ever seen the actors give exceptional performances  the most complex and incredibly played character is that of leonardo dicaprio  he never turns in a bad performance  i think inception is an underrated work of his all characters in this movie fill a purpose and they are great  some people don t like the fact that ariadne  elliot page  only exists to ask questions  i do not mind this  i think it s a clever and effective way to introduce the audience to the complex concepts and ideas of inception one of the biggest critiques christopher nolan gets is that his movies lack emotion  i have however never found this to be a problem  i prefer action driven movies over character driven movies  i believe that a rather cold main character works perfectly fine in a movie like inception  i watch inception because i love the plot and the action  i watch inception because i want to experience something else  something truly epic  i don t watch inception to cry i would also argue that inception is not quite as emotionless as some people say  the movie has got enough heart to make the viewer sympathize with the characters and that is enough in my opinion  inception is however a big improvement in this department  tom hardy s character is a great addition to this movie  the film becomes significantly more playful and doesn t take itself quite as seriously as nolan s earlier work  without taking away from its weight there are many reasons why i love christopher nolan  his movies are always thought provoking and sometimes hard to understand  but still very interesting  his movies are almost better on a second viewing because there is always something new to discover i am not the biggest fan of sci fi movies  but inception is an exception  exception not inception lol   despite some concepts being very surrealistic  inception is still grounded  i think the practical effects  sets  and stunts play a big part in this  christopher nolan likes to use as little computer generated imagery as humanly possible  everything you see in inception is real  that s what separates inception and nolan s other work from many other science fiction films not only do practical effects look more real  but it helps the actors to give better performances  it s way harder to act in front of a green screen than to act in a spinning hallway  it also makes the movie timeless  computer generated imagery is improved every year and does not age quite as well as a great practical effect hans zimmer is without a doubt one of the greatest composers of all time   time  is one of the greatest pieces of music ever created for a motion picture  the score conveys an epic and adventurous atmosphere  the music elevates the suspense and makes the movie twice as good one aspect which i like about the movie is the way it flows  the pacing is great  and i was always entertained  nolan likes to use the practice known as  in media res   or as a friend of mine likes to call it  pulp fiction   it s used as a literary term to describe when a story opens with the character already in the middle of things   whether it be a high speed car chase  or a man being washed up on the beach  this narrative technique is a great way to capture the audience s attention  as dicaprio s character explains in the movie  dreams always start amid things  this movie uses this practice very well  we always skip the non important and boring stuff and get straight to the action  everything is still explained and well set up  but we skip the boring stuff which we do not need the opening sequence is breathtaking  it features some great stunts and action and it s truly mind boggling  it was love at first sight  it captures the attention of the viewer and sets the bar high for the rest of the film  a lot of concepts are introduced in this sequence  and it is very well done  also  i love the song  dream is collapsing  inception is a beautiful movie  the cinematography and the special and visual effects are great  i think miniatures are a great tool to use in moviemaking  miniatures have this reality that digital effects haven t gotten to yet  it s incredibly hard using cg to recreate complicated actions like explosions and falling buildings  a great example of the use of miniatures is the explosion of the james bond like base in the snowy mountains some people argue that nolan doesn t know how to choreograph a great hand to hand combat scene  i understand this argument  but i do not believe this applies to inception  there are few hand to hand combat scenes in this movie and one of which is executed perfectly  the hallway scene with joseph gordon levitt  nolan s fight scenes sometimes lack innovative fight choreography  but they succeed in other aspects  nolan would rather have the audience remember the significance and meaning of the fight  rather than the fight itself  i think that the fight choreography itself isn t great in the hallway scene  but it doesn t take away from the scene  other crazy things are happening the movie is regarded for its praiseworthy editing  even though it wasn t even nominated for the best film editing award in the academy awards 2010  the biggest task was to portray the complexity of dreams within dreams  but it was done elegantly  inception uses a lot of parallel editing  cutting from high speed chases to slow motion sequences  if it weren t for the editor  the film would have come out as a complete mess  the movie flows and it s edited in a way to always keep the audience on their toes many people find this movie very complex and sometimes hard to understand but i love it  i love to be challenged by a film  the ending of inception is iconic and remains one of the best movie endings of all time  dicaprio s character  a  k  a cobb  spins his totem but then he sees his children  he doesn t wait for the totem to stop spinning  he walks over to his children and inception cuts away before the audience discovers the truth the ending has been discussed every year since the release of the movie  cobb doesn t care whether he is dreaming or awake  throughout inception  nolan presents two very different planes of existence  the real world and the dream world  the final scene is intended to blur those lines   cobb s reality is whatever he chooses  this begs the question  does it matter which reality he chooses to live in  it s a question i find very intriguing and interesting there are other hidden meanings in inception  for inception to work  the subject must believe that the idea is his her own  inception is something we experience daily by the news  the internet  and television  we are constantly fed with opinions and ideas and sometimes they stick  i m not educated enough to talk further about this subject  but it s just food for thought my review doesn t do this movie justice  this movie is ineffable  inception was the film that made me fall in love with cinema  i have tried hard to explain how great i think this movie is but there is still so much more to be said  inception is too great to be expressed in words  inception is a movie not to be missed  it s a masterpiece worth every second of your time  i was blown away the first time i watched it  i could never take my eyes off it and when the credits rolled  my jaw dropped  and i could do nothing but stand up and applaud  my mind was blown away,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.977932333946228, 'elapsed_time': 0.21924161911010742}",positive

i cannot understand why this movie is rated so highly  it is infantile in its storyline and soooo boring  my young teen son was raving about it and forced me to go to it  he was very happy that i was there the 2nd time as i was able to wake him up from the total brainwashing of modern movie making hollywood style  first of all take a very lousy infantile script and dress it up with all kinds of jargon about dreams and subconscious but in fact the story makes no sense at all and has a crude central storyline that is ridiculous   a teenager could make it up  next take a good smattering of hollywood a list actors to make it look slick  get a fantastic stunt crew and great special effects team to make this silly stupid storyline look amazing and keep a bunch of immature easily duped people in their seats for two hours thinking they are watching ground breaking cinema but in fact are watching a story that does not have any substance and a plot that is fit for a 14 year old  meanwhile the 14 year old mindset believes in the illusion of the picture and gets  hooked in  with the violence and the extra wow factor of hollywood over the top visual blackmail  once i had exposed this trickery to the 14 year old who by the way woke up and saw it for what it was  meaningless tripe  it was worth the entrance fee just for that  don t waste your time,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.0018854932859539986, 'elapsed_time': 0.22024750709533691}",negative
acclaimed director christopher nolan scores with the general movie going audience once again with his highly anticipated film inception  2010   the hook for this film is it s exploration into the concept and idea of  dreams   frankly  my immediate response when i saw this film was that the it s definition of dreams seems to be more based on nolan s interpretation and not the general consensus  some of it sounded correct  while some of it sounded like mumbo jumbo  at the same time  nolan essentially executes the dream aspects of the movie within his own set of rules and more or less does not violate them  which is actually part of the problem  in the big picture  i don t think dreams work the way this movie portrays them inception stars leonardo dicaprio as dream expert extractor cobb  dicaprio gives a passable performance  but it s not anything mesmerizing or oscar caliber  frankly  i think that this actor is probably the most overrated major star of the last decade  it s partially that he s a victim of his eternal youthful look  so it makes it hard to take him seriously in these  adult  roles  i feel like he s being forced upon me as a star  rather than truly being one  unlike when he was a teen actor in the early to mid 90s  i don t find him very engaging as an adult actor  he simply doesn t draw me in  and  actually  in this movie  i was more engaged by the other ensemble s performances more than his  he felt like a 5th wheel  especially since it was his character that was actually an impediment to the mission succeeding the real acting standouts in the film for me were cillian murphy and former best actress oscar winner marion cotillard  murphy plays the team s target robert fischer  whose billionaire industrialist father had recently died  so cobb s team was on an assignment  paid by fischer s main competitor saito  a solid ken watanabe  to implant an idea in his mind to liquidate his father s empire  murphy did a much better job showing depth and character detail than dicaprio  whose tale was actually more tragic  with his dreams haunted by the memory of his late wife mal  hauntingly played by cotillard  and i actually didn t realize it was her until the end credits rolled   the capable supporting cast playing cobb s  dream team  is led by up and coming star ellen page  as ariadne  a specialist in architecture  who constructs the dream landscape for the film s big mission   although she was underused mainly as a fascinated observer and cobb s support  i found page to be very engaging  after constructing the dream landscape  ariadne s assignment was to protect cobb from his demonic subconscious in the form of his late wife mal  joseph gordon levitt is fine also as arthur  cobb s sidekick who monitors the dreamers to ensure that they eventually get  kicked   treated rather flimsily in this movie   out of them  tom hardy is also good as eames  a forger whose expertise is needed in the dreams to shapeshift his appearance to the dreamer  dileep rao soundly functions as chemist yusef  creator of the drug that will allow the team to go into 3 levels of dream states in order to execute the mission where inception actually drew me in was in the last half  with it s steamrolling action sequences as the dreamers went from level to level  which i did not expect at all  i thought this was going to be some kind of mind bending  trippy exercise  which it really wasn t  the way the movie portrays dreaming is actually very pat and linear  and the miniscule complexity is what allows the viewer to follow and be more engaged in the action  that is  while not completely mindless  pardon the pun    the dream state stuff is pretty easy to follow  also  nolan did a good job of defining how the different levels work in the film s opening sequence my biggest complaint about the film is it s rather simplistic way of describing dreams  and this ties in with the dicaprio character cobb  who was the biggest detriment to the mission because of his subconscious drawing his wife mal into the dreams at inopportune moments  other than the dreamer himself  why weren t any of the other teams subconscious in the dreams coming into play  basically  cobb was the only team member whose subconscious posed a wild card threat  which is hard to believe  if you take cobb out of the equation  the mission runs a lot smoother than it actually did  cobb is the only reason for a true threat to exist and for there to be any suspense  and after a while  i found the cobb mal stuff to be more of a distraction than an important plot point  minus cobb  the movie is really just a simple action flick with no true threats in the dreams other than the main dreamer s typical subconscious threats  which were basically a bunch of useless gun toting brutes who couldn t hit the side of a barn  again  it was all very entertaining  but definitely not groundbreaking inception was nominated for best picture  in part i think due to the fact that there are 10 nominations now  chances are it would not have been nominated if there were only still 5 since nolan himself didn t garner a best director nomination  enteraining experience  but definitely not oscar worthy,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.995413064956665, 'elapsed_time': 0.2419126033782959}",positive
first off  it s clear that these imdb ratings are no longer valid  this film was just  ok  by anyone s standards  except maybe the plethora of teenagers that love anything that includes lots of gun fire and  splosions  the plot was unnecessarily convoluted and chock full of lazy writing  i have really liked chris nolan s work  so this is not a personal attack on him  it s just nowhere near as slick as others have claimed  the biggest symptoms of lazy writing are  constant exposition in the guise of conversation  constant changing of rules set up earlier in the movie and supposedly brilliant people making illogical choices  when the plot demands it  many have said that those of us who didn t like it were just clueless and didn t  get it   what s to get  the plot was not difficult to understand  just difficult to accept as anything that made any sense  a dream with a dream within a dream  big effing deal  i bought this film on dvd and couldn t wait to see it as so many people had hailed it as the best thing since citizen kane  i was left feeling empty and ripped off  then again  there is an entire generation that claims  transformers  and  independence day  are two of the best films ever made  i fail to understand how this over blown  over hyped film could garner such high ratings unless the people doing the rating have never seen a movie over 20 ears old  the concept was high minded but the execution was pure popcorn munching tripe  while i ll admit the cinematography was gorgeous and the acting was fairly well done  it was just so empty  as others have pointed out  when it s all just a dream  there s not a lot of tension when faceless people are shooting at you  just plain silly  i say   as an aside  south park did a very funny dream within a dream within a dream years ago,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.022402722388505936, 'elapsed_time': 0.20366215705871582}",negative
don t get me wrong  christopher nolan  writer  producer and director of this movie  is a very  very talented filmmaker  he will undoubtedly make that masterpiece for which he will be remembered  but that s just my point  he hasn t made it yet  the dark knight wasn t it and inception certainly isn t it  inception is a product of a director who has been given carte blanche  his vision has been put on film without someone ever saying   chris  that s not going to work   for that matter  inception should have been nolan s heaven s gate  but inception will probably make nolan a even bigger star  he better check his totem i felt compelled to write a review when i found out this movie had a 9 2 rating and a 3rd place overall in the top 250  let me say  that is ridiculous  to balance the scale  i have rated this movie  a ridiculous  1  i agree with some posts on the message board of imdb  complex does not mean intellectual or smart  and for that matter  i don t think this film is very complex  it just asks what most movies do  go with it dicaprio gives a pretty good performance  with leftovers from his role in shutter island  as dobbs  a person who is able the penetrate someone s dream and see or steal his secrets  recently dobbs lost his wife and he has not seen his children in a long time  that is because the authorities think he has something to do with his wife s death  watanabe gives dobbs a chance to get his life back  he needs to plant an idea  inception  in the mind of a competitor  like a seed  it will grow  and the inspiration for the idea will seem real one of the problems for me with the movie was that the dreamworld felt pretty flat and boring to me  unlike the matrix  a inception for this movie   the inhabitants of the other world do not bend the rules of gravity  the laws of physics do apply  that s not a bad decision  but i agree with one reviewer   nolan s dreamworld looks like a mediocre action film from the 90 s   the bad guys walk around like video game characters with an ai set on level easy  i almost shouted in the theater when eames went rambo in the snow scene  i understand the decision  look at the cell to see how wrong you can go if you explore the subconscious on film  but still  for me his decision to keep the dreamworld neat and clean is a cop out  dreams don t look like this  hopes  fears and experiences mix with  the conception of  the real world and you get a pretty original result sometimes  none of this in inception  oh right  the architect is in control  how convenient the whole dream within a dream concept was a little far fetched for me  have you ever had one  probably not  so why  when you have a pretty basic dreamworld go with a concept this unreal  the real world does influence the dream the character s have  but they feel it and are conscious that it is the real world  that s a missed opportunity  a dream influenced by factor s unknown to the dreamer could have made it much more enjoyable for the audience maybe it s just not my cup of tea  like nolan s former projects the prestige and the dark knight  i don t get all the hoopla  yes  these movies  like inception  are well made  they are original  have refreshing ideas  are technically good and have decent scripts  but they are not the best of the decade  and this one really is not a 9 2  i d say a 5 5  barely,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.1755872368812561, 'elapsed_time': 0.21295380592346191}",negative
when i watch a movie  all sorts of machinery kicks in  i am aware of only some of that  and can massage and train only a bit of that   of what i see of myself this machinery is based on layers  folding  recursion  it is just how the mind works  this business of seeing self some art   i would argue all   fits into this equation in some way  surfing  deflating  revealing some part of the flow  the most exciting to me are those that expose the machinery itself  the folding dynamics  oh  i have no illusion that this or any simple equation is  the answer   but it seems that we do live in movies  our life is the movie we make  if we want valuable art  it will be art that reminds us of that fact  a movie that is powerful enough to let us know the limits of its power nolan will get credit for making an entertaining artifact  the intelligence   no simply the complexity   of the story makes us invest  it is why folding works with the marketplace  it increases the entanglement we make with the story  then nolan can drag in cinematic effects that otherwise would be ordinary  bombs  gunfights  carchases    and we see them as extraordinary because of the perceptive entanglement this works as well for our relationship with the actor  in interviews  leonardo is talking openly about what first level actors know  that you deliver the character  but you also deliver a folded presentation having to do with the knowledge the actor and viewer share about the whole process  how does one play a character that is a character within  how do you project an awareness of withinness as with  following  and  memento   it isn t just about the layers  it is about how they affect one another and how they include the folds of the presentation as a film  and as we live i would like to remark on only one aspect of how nolan put this together  space  we have all sorts of life values represented here  we have the noir detective  the pilgrimage to family  the deceiver  the drivers    all with designated characters  in there we have the architect  she is the fourth that we know  the first is the father  played by michael caine  he is a master professor of some stripe   we don t really know  what we do know is caine s face  one of the most familiar in film  nolan knows him as bruce wayne s caretaker  the keeper of the enabling space for batman  including the space carried in the costume cape  his son  leonardo s character  has taken his dad s empire of the mind and broken it down for use in layers  the other father here is a surrogate for cobb s  cobb is presumed to be the master architect  but is hampered  so he has to seek others  one we see briefly at the beginning  someone who fails  the one of interest to us is recommended by the dad as superior to cobb  enter ariadne  the goddess of the labyrinth  what in the business is called a four  a reality savant she is the designer and guide of everything we see  everything  she is the magi  the creator  everything we see is something she made  even the illusion cobb  has that in an inner dream he made something and lived in it for decades  even  even the possible illusion that he returns  even the more ambiguous architecture of lives that cobb believes he experienced   a lifetime with his wife there is one scene where this is not so   where the world is not ariadne s  and for me it is the key scene  i hold it as the anchor around which i build everything our actual romance  cobb and ariadne  are in their first shared space  her first dream experience  this is cobb s dream  his architecture  they are sitting outside by a paris cafe  one of filmdoms most seductive places   it seems to quote  irma la douce  in more ways than one  but certainly in the set   he is seducing her into helping him build an inner world   risky  more engaging than anything can be  it is for the purpose of regaining his children  as he settles with his father  and incidentally saving the world from energy tyranny he is grizzled  worn out from past wars of the mind  he has just suffered a defeat because of an inadequate architect  he is at the end of his life  this will be his last job  she is at the beginning of hers  her face is fresh  her self open  her mind powerful but innocent  he explains that everything she sees is created by him  he then proceeds to create what has to be the best use of cinematic space i know  the environment deconstructs  it doesn t explode so much as is ceases to become boundaries of space and becomes space itself  dense  breathable  it is the most powerful  erotic thing i have experienced on screen  his space penetrates her skin to the core  when they awake  he knows he has her   forever my believe is that nolan opened the possibility that moll was something he and she co  created as part of the labyrinth we go through with them  noir wise  it is all about the fall  the connection among layers  the penetration into the soul  nolan drapes a thriller around this

wow what have we here  what hast thou put before our eyes  could it be christopher nolan s boorish tripe  inception   i myself could not tell as the movie was far too low brow to make even the slightest impression on my vastly superior intelligence  nolan is an amateur who makes movies based on blatantly foreseeable childish artifices that only the most unintelligent boors would find the least bit amusing   inception  is the kind of film designed to make lamebrains feel like they are intelligent  nolan s intellectualism for dummies should be the main title of his biography  luckily i am smart enough to see past this charade and give the people their fair assessment of this tripe  inception  is built upon the notion of traveling through dream like spaces that bend time  space  and reality  yawn  it s been done before chris in a much sounder fashion in charlie kaufman s epic masterpiece  synecdoche  new york   that film is an orgasmic experience while  inception  is just beyond words describing it  i mean you might conclude that the inner subconscious would be more creative in coming up with better metaphors for security than guys with guns who chase you  the lengthy exposition  oh i mean training montage  despite having a semi acceptable computer effect  was way more boring and less engaging than the scene it stole from  the matrix   and at least that scene didn t have nolan s pretentiousness  larry the cable guy is less insulting to the intellect  i mean sarah palin sounds smarter than christopher nolan s dialogue    conjointly  the herculean careener of mesh networks is titled ariadne  really  none of the juveniles that give you your millions will get that reference chris but i m glad you know how to use wikipedia,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.004799319431185722, 'elapsed_time': 0.20523548126220703}",negative
i must admit i was really looking forward to this film but as with most of the big blockbusters in recent years it was a rather overrated experience  a good cast and some good acting but an overly complicated script and convoluted way of going about stuff using ideas from a lot of decent films that have gone before  the argument that if you don t like it you are too dumb to understand it does not wash as it s easy enough to understand what s going on but why it s going on does not make that much sense  one example is that for no sensible reason leo is involved in a domestic situation that results in his wife s death and now seems to be worldwide public enemy number one we have the usual assembling of an elite team to go in and carry out the usual impossible mission with consequences that are unknown to most of the team members that will impact on their success or not  well that s original chucking sci fi babble into a story does not always enhance the story and most of the inception idea tech talk is boring and nonsensical the  shock  ending is predictable and has been signposted since pretty much the start of the film which was overlong and overcomplicated and not at all as intelligent as it was made out to be  like shutter island leo is once again involved in a film that promises a lot but delivers not a great deal  some spectacular sets and nice effects cannot cover up an ordinary fun bit of sci fi nonsense passed off as genius  like avatar before it thinking it is some kind of genre changing piece of film when its just a half decent bit of entertainment that will linger with an audience until they get to the car park of kfc thought provoking cinema seems destined to be left behind for this kind of multi layered pseudo sci fi babble which looks pretty but is not as clever as it likes to think,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.27749794721603394, 'elapsed_time': 0.22946858406066895}",negative

but not for me  the movie unmasks itself as a very uninspired convoluted pseudo something when the protagonists have to find an alternative dream tactic because their target protects himself  what they consider to be a new psychological trick is so plain and unoriginal that becomes clear with a  kick  that nolan was absolutely unaware of any scientific profound background by developing the plot  the plot within a plot within a plot is not automatically an  intellectual  challenging procedure when one plot is the exact mirror of the other  the challenge for me was to stay awake whilst the plot stumbles from one hole to the next how do they get connected so that can dream the same dream  chemically  physically   how can they transport their conscious plans into their unconscious dreams and execute them there  etc   etc i can t help it  but nolan is one of the few directors in hollywood who can direct any script as tedious as you can imagine  there are so many moments in that movie where i thought wow  that could have been much more suspenseful if  for instance  cameron or so had directed it this movie is stupid  you can make a stupid plot  intelligent  by nesting it multiple times  it just multiplies its stupidity  in this sense the next nolan movie could be a even greater  masterpiece  for meat heads  when it has a dump base plot every fool can follow  but this time the plot is the plot in the plot in the plot in the plot in the     that s challenging isn t it,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.003756321966648102, 'elapsed_time': 0.3696432113647461}",negative

i decided to go back and review inception because this would be my 100th review written for imdb  and interstellar is coming in a few months so i guess now is a good time to celebrate one of the greatest films of all time  after dozens of times watching this movie i ranked it as my third favorite movie of all time  rightfully so  considering it s one of the few movies that changed my life and got me infinitely interested in film in general  from top to bottom this is one true cinematic accomplishment  christopher nolan created a worldwide phenomena and did it with an original idea  popular and financially successful movies these days almost always have to be part of a bigger franchise  inception made nearly a billion dollars while being just a solo outing  this wasn t nolan s first home run twisting our minds and it won t be his last but he most likely won t create a more original movie than inception  it s one of those movies that after you see it  you instantly want to go back and watch it again the cast is flooded with hall of fame level talent  beginning with leonardo dicaprio in his first and hopefully not last film with christopher nolan  these two created a perfect team and i couldn t have pictured a better actor for the role of dom cobb  i love how the movie doesn t give us any back story on his character and almost assumes that planting ideas inside peoples minds is normal  joseph gordon levitt creates a good balance with cobb in his role as arthur  jgl was well known among hollywood for awhile but inception catapulted his career to a new level  he doesn t get his roles in looper  lincoln  the dark knight rises  or even get to direct his film don jon without starring in inception  easily some of the best scenes in the movie are him trying to calm down cobb and understand why it is he cant focus while in the dream world  this is when the beautiful marion cotillard comes into play  she plays the recently passed wife of cobb  but someone who doesn t seem to leave cobb s subconscious  her accent and seductiveness was perfect for mal cobb and also shared some of the not only epic but also psychologically thrilling scenes the rest of the team is filled with rising stars tom hardy  ellen page  and the ever so underrated ken watanabe  page is one who in the trailers seemed to come across as annoying and useless but i was pleasantly surprised with how great her performance was  overall the cast is one of the best ensembles ever put together  without forgetting the always good michael caine  but the real praise goes out to hans zimmer for creating my favorite and quite possibly one of the greatest scores of all time   time  is my favorite single piece of music  but the rest of the score hits at exactly the right times  it s explosive and also emotionally moving when it needs to be  zimmer found the perfect mix of brass and piano to use in this oscar snubbed score but i think the real reason this film became so popular and re watchable was because of it s forever debatable ending  what s my take on it  well after replaying it for years and going back and forth on what my opinion is i would say that it doesn t matter  it doesn t matter if he is suppose to be dreaming or finally back to reality  you know why  because dom cobb doesn t care  when he sees his children s faces in the end that was the final straw  he doesn t even bother looking at the top spinning because it means he is getting to see his children  he is accepting the fact that his wife is dead and never coming back and moving on from that fact  i really do believe that he had reached reality but i always love hearing the new theories people come up with  i have basically heard them all at this point but it doesn t matter because cobb has accepted his fate  true props to nolan for creating material that people are sure to be talking about for years to come so after over a decade of nolan having his idea for inception he finally got it made  warner bros gave him the go ahead after he made them billions with the batman films and could it have been a better decision  i don t think so  nolan created a film that has impeccable practical effects with an unbelievable ensemble cast complimented with perfect cinematography and a haunting score  if there s ever such thing as a perfect film this is it  it s one of the few movies that makes me cry thinking about how great cinema is when its done with the care like inception is  it renews my faith in cinema  dicaprio and ensemble cast give career defining performances originality can t be topped hans zimmer s exhilarating score practical effects  hotel scene  forever debatable ending gave america marion cotillard final scene time10 10,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9977510571479797, 'elapsed_time': 0.2978837490081787}",positive

i can t believe i wasted 6 dollars to see this movie at the theater  it was a waste of 2 hours and 20 minutes  i don t know why this movie got so much praise  it s a pointless sci fi movie that should have gone straight to video  i see some reviews say this movie was better than star wars  you have got to be kidding  unlike inception star wars had a great story  the actors even though unknown at the time impressed me  and the special effects wow  i must say star wars blows inception out of the water still to this day  to anyone who doesn t think so must be too young to know that it took a lot more effort in the 70 s to make a great film  i was really disappointed in inception  i thought since nolan did the dark knight movies this would be another success  this movie was slow  boring and really had no plot  the only thing i took from it was it was a dreams and getting into peoples heads in there most vulnerable time while they are dreaming  the ending was a wtf ending the kind that can make or break movies  but since this on was broken from the start the ending really didn t surprise me  to all who want to see a great sci fi movie pick up the classic  like alein  star wars  blade runner  equilibrium  etc   i know from watching these movies and being a big fan of the sw saga  you won t be disappointed  hey btw  looking for a great tv mini series blockbuster from the 80 s checkout v and v the final battle  these movies are classics and i would recommend them to anyone who likes a great sci fi movie thx  kris l  cockayne,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.14629095792770386, 'elapsed_time': 0.3344895839691162}",negative

people love to talk about the relationship between cinema and dreams  as a slightly surreal artform in and of itself  directors and artists have always tweaked with the filmic space of perception to achieve dream or dream like effects  the problem i typically find in almost all movies attempting to recreate dreams is that they do so in too literal a way  often drawing attention to the dream effect they are portraying  this becomes even more difficult to pull off in movies that question the line between dreams and reality  a much more obvious line than pop philosophy ever really acknowledges  pretty much have to point out the dream techniques of the production you are watching  this is nolan s central dilemma  and one he doesn t really manage to transcend  as a visual invention in technical prestidigitation  this movie is successful  but it is too bogged down by exposition to really let its dream scapes breathe really  this movie is closer to the matrix than paprika  a satoshi kon animated movie i expected it to be closer to  a core group of technopirates get into people s dreams to steal information  but now they are a challenged by a corporate agent to actually plant an idea in the head of a target instead of steal the idea  this process is called inception  now nolan goes the correct route and centers the action around the head of the dream stalkers  cobb  played by leonardo dicaprio  seems cobb has some mental juju to work out that keeps  projecting  into the missions he undertakes  nolan misses the point of freudian  projection   but hits a cute pun on the very medium we are watching   so as these mercenaries of the subconscious get ready for their mission  it is complicated by the fact that their intrepid leader at any point can cause phantasmic chaos  enter a few rules about dying and waking up  losing your mind and creating mental labyrinths  and you basically have the movie s own architecture for what ultimately  when it comes down to it  past all the rhetoric and screen wizardry  becomes a series of set pieces nolan creates a world where this technology exists  and sets the rules of the technology  he then adds the element that in a world where that technology exists  rich people like cobb s target would have defenses set up  these defenses translate into literal nobody adversaries for whiz bang action  in order that death seem actually like a bad thing  beyond just waking up   he sets limbo  then the movie goes  losing track of what is essentially at the core of everything the audience cares about  cobb s inception  and the working through the guilt he has  i guess ultimately nolan didn t want to remake shutter island  i m not sure dicaprio really felt a huge difference between either role so we re not in legitimate dream world here  the characters are too aware  the dreamy twists on reality are pointed out and explained via direct real world correlations  the subconscious is generally predictable and follows ineffectual actions from barely described motivations  and in order to get there nolan has to cram way too much exposition into the first twenty minutes  instead of dwell on the central drama of the entire movie  cobb and his wife  that s fine because then we re in nolan s world  not dream world  and he can make any rules he wants  so he does  and you get    you know     chase sequences  siberian battles  explosions  if nolan is expressing anything in his subconscious here  it s that he deeply regrets not having an opportunity yet to direct a james bond movie however it s not all that bad  the story of cobb  the creation of the labyrinths  the technical beauty of it all is engaging science fiction cinema  the only root problem is nolan s asking of the somewhat clichéd albeit age old question   what is the difference between dreams and reality   because no filmmaker who brings up this question never answers that question definitively  audiences shouldn t expect for it to be here  however  nolan does miss one definite thing about dreams that does not work in his scenario in inception  cobb and his wife live  and age  for years in a dream world of their own creation  later  his wife cannot tell if them waking up came to another level of dream  or if they finally achieved reality  i would just point out the obvious  in dreams  you never go to sleep  you may wake up  but even in inception  going to sleep within sleep requires an apparatus problem solved   polarisdib,"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5407752394676208, 'elapsed_time': 0.27664852142333984}",neutral

that main idea though  is something very unique and creative that is brought to life by outstanding filmmaking  everything you d expect from a christopher nolan film  writing and performances are also great across the board  the only problem with inception is in ones own interpretation  some may says it s pretentious and the ideas presented acctualy aren t fully understood by the creators and or don t make sense  but i think that s a terrible angle to approach the film  it s sci fi  you re not supposed to over anylasie it in that way  it s meant to plant thought provoking ideas in your head  which i beleive it does very well  not be a perfectly logical and plausible idea  yes  it does have a few questionable sequences and scenarios  esspecally at the end  but it doesn t drag the rest of the movie down at all to me  it s a must watch","{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9766360521316528, 'elapsed_time': 0.28812479972839355}",positive
leonardo dicaprio stars in the movie i ve been waiting for for over a year  inception  and to tell you the truth  it was worth the wait  i waited so long  without knowing what it was about  because i know that any film that christopher nolan  who directed my favorite film the dark knight  will blow my mind  and he does it with his new masterpiece  nolan has made one of my top three favorite films of all time  i haven t loved a film more since the dark knight  there hasn t been a mind blowingly original film since memento  coincidently  they are from the same director  inception is one of the greatest movies ever made  it s the best film of the year  it is going to be overall  it is probably going to be the best film of the decade  and the decades to come now  how do i describe it  dom cobb played by leonardo dicaprio  has the ability to enter a person s dreams and steal secrets from that  him and his team which includes ellen page  joseph gordon levitt  dileep rao  and tom hardy  do that inception is when you plant an idea in somebody s head  some of them believe it s a myth  cobb knows it isn t though  he knows it exists  and that is what cobb and his team try to do there is more to the plot than that  there are things involving cobb s wife mal played excellently by marion cotillard  and robert fischer jr  played by cillian murphey  another nolan regular   but to tell you the truth  i can t exactly explain it  it s very complex  and too smart  and i d be ashamed to explain this film i d be ashamed to explain it because it s too brilliant  it took christopher nolan ten years to write it  i can see how  it took me over a year to see it  and it will probably take me more than once to understand it fully there hasn t been a film that i ve loved more since the dark knight  inception is on my top three favorite movies  it s the most original  emotionally complex complex emotional  visually exhilarating brainy and well shot motion picture in years the ending is brilliant  nolan has almost outdone himself  i would say it s almost as good as the dark knight  i have loved all of nolan s films  inception  the dark knight and the prestige are all on my top five nolan has never shot a better film this is his best thriller  it s like films like vanilla sky but it blows them away  though i liked that movie  inception is the best movie of the year it will remain the best movie of the year  it will most likely be my favorite film of the decade  and the decades to come  i guess that is until another nolan movie comes out  because he is a director that has a specialty in blowing our minds and outdoing himself inception is an amazing movie that will probably get better within repeated showings  you won t find a better film this summer  screw those toy story 3 lovers though i loved it too  inception is fantastic inception a,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9951169490814209, 'elapsed_time': 0.37197089195251465}",positive

a visual tour de force that gets lost in its own complex world  inception stars leonardo dicaprio as dom cobb  a rogue  extractor  who steals elements of dreams and sells them to the highest bidder  all in the name of corporate espionage  but things start to go drastically wrong when cobb takes on a seemingly impossible job and his dead wife turns up to make trouble ingenious but convoluted  inception may not be to everyone s taste   but it is undoubtedly a chris nolan picture  the same man who gave us memento  the prestige and of course  the dark knight  the problem is that for all the slick visuals and clever narrative structures  we end up with something cold  clinical and frustratingly diffuse why inception falters  and i appreciate that i may be in the minority  is that for such a surreal and imaginative concept to work  it requires an equally surreal and imaginative mind  and nolan is just too conservative and too technical for the content  it might have made a more interesting film had it been directed by p t anderson or  dare i say it  terry gilliam,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9913912415504456, 'elapsed_time': 0.5951962471008301}",positive
not many movies rate a 9 10  especially when averaged over almost a quarter of a million votes  so   devoted sci fi freak that i am  and being so often disappointed by cheap sf offerings   i was sure i was on a winner however after viewing the movie last night  i found it confusing and inconclusive  i understand the basic concept  that by entering a person s subconscious  it might be possible to steal or implant information   thoughts  without the subject later being aware    it was all a dream  however in the main phase of the movie  where cobb  dicaprio  is tasked by saito  watanabe  with implanting fischer  murphy  with an idea which will neutralise his rival  the end of the matter seems to be that fischer  who always thought his dad regarded his as a loser   a disappointment   in fact simply wanted him to be himself i e  to realise his own potential  surely this would be empowering rather than diminishing or defeating  as saito wanted the intrusion of dom s wife mal and kids into many scenes was an excessive distraction which seemed to get the movie too far from what was supposed to be happening  interesting idea  that they d already spent some 50 years together in a deep dream layer    but a bit too far fetched  real dreamstates are certainly tinged with reality  but not the concrete reality expressed in the movie  only when dom enters his own world towards the end of the movie  do we see skyscrapers which look like plain cardboard boxes  it would have been unacceptable to audiences if the  dream invaders  had entered a more cloudy reality  the old idea of heaven  as is commonly experienced in dreams i notice many reviewers who gave the movie a 9 or 10 10 say it must be viewed multiple times in order to be fully understood  is this really the mark of a good movie these days  it must be studied like a high school text  i greatly prefer spielberg s method of storytelling   complex and very entertaining but comprehensible in one sitting and what s with all the gunfire  i understand that subjects can be psychologically prepared to resist extraction or perhaps implantation  but much of the gunplay seemed gratuitous  simply there for audiences expected as some sort of crowd pleaser the cgi and cinematography is first rate  but nothing really compensates if the basic story is not comprehensible well it s a movie i will certainly keep in my sf collection  and no doubt i will watch it at least once more to try and see what others find so appealing  6 10,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9951462149620056, 'elapsed_time': 0.7799572944641113}",positive

i was on the verge of leaving the cinema on this completely ridiculously story  i hung in there  also despite the insanely annoying music  though  and am simply shocked that the film has  currently  a top 3 position of movies ever made  perhaps i have entered a  bad  dream and have not yet woken up   so the backdrop of the story is basically that a bunch of guys drug people and enter a dream world using a plastic box with wires attached to those entering the dream  in this dream they use the same technique  the box and drugs are now just apart of this dream    to enter another dream  this process can be repeated a number of times   and in the movie they go to the fourth dream layer  if you are killed while dreaming you will wake up   unless you are too heavily sedated  in real life  or also in one of the dreams      which will then put you in a  limbo  state   which can potentially last for years  if you want to get out of a dream safely   you need to be  kicked   sharp acceleration  in the dream layer above the one you are currently in  if you are unsure if you are dreaming or not  you have a  totem   a physical object that for some unspecified reason behaves differently in a dream   why   that you can examine i just hate it  simply hate it   the only good thing i see in this movie is the ending  dicaprio sees his kids again   but they look exactly as they have done in his dreams   they have not aged at all  this means that he is still dreaming and he is therefore stuck in a new limbo dream world   and will be there for a long time  phew    that means there won t be a sequel until he wakes up again  unless it is me that s still dreaming,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.10849545150995255, 'elapsed_time': 0.879734992980957}",negative
this film was supposed to knock my socks off  well  i m still wearing them  because this film was such a disappointment  i thought  memento  was brilliant  but  dark knight  a con  although this was supposed to be a total nolan film  it should have been his  heaven s gate    a much better film by the way  but it has proved almost  titanic   again a much better film   indeed  the audience left the cinema asking each other  did you enjoy it   as if they thought it was rubbish  but had to find out whether it was ok to say it was  it was let s face it  the plot is little more than a pretend heist movie on a par with  ocean s 12   but it is hidden away in a complicated story of dreams and dreamworlds   three levels worth with each level allowing more time in it compared to reality  gottit  you should do because di caprio spends acres of screen time explaining it to the complete and utter boredom of the audience  cinema  doctor k   i think not  it all boils down to finding out why the hero s wife died and how are the gang going to plant an idea in the head of a major industrialist  eg inception   following this  as the climax boils  in an extremely prosaic dreamworld hardly worth the effort and cgi  on three different levels   one a minibus falling off a bridge  interminably in slow motion   the second tom hardy s screen test for the remake of  on her majesty s secret service  complete with ski shooters  blofeld s alpine fortress  and an enemy that cannot kill a hero from five yards   and the third  a legoland where di caprio s wife is skulking siren like to lure him to stay forever   the film really creaks and shows its  paucity of vision  script  characters  and downright boringness  i have to excuse some of it because i needed the loo and could not get out of my row  yes  i had a totem which kept me firmly in reality   i knew how long we had to go by how far the minibus had to fall   and the plot holes   many  but the worst involved the cillian murphy getting killed in the second level which should have left him in mindless limbo on level 3  but he was dead there as well  while ken watanabe who died in level 2  became a very old man in level 3     and right at the end  cillian murphy has been trained to resist dream thieves  and when he wakes up  he finds himself in the cabin with the gang but does not put two and two together and realise they are the real thieves having persuaded him in his dream otherwise   gettit  don t bother  it was probably all di caprio s dream anyway   a load of old tosh that has nolan laughing all the way to the bank  and many so called serious critics facing the sack for lavishly overpraising a piece of mediocre tosh,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.002894357778131962, 'elapsed_time': 0.6054461002349854}",negative
inception   i saw this a while ago  i only write about it  because south park was making fun of it last night  i never got the enthusiasm for this flick  it was somewhat entertaining  although  certainly not mind blowing or even that inventive  i ve seen more mind bending things on the outer limits from the 60 s  it was not memorable  in fact  i had forgotten about it until last night  one of the things i remember was how poorly ellen page s character was rounded out  i remember laughing  not at her   but at the part she had to play  ms  exposition  explain everything to her  so the audience knows what is going on  the action was cliché  and left me wanting more  the whole thing about going into someone s dream is so silly  but not funny silly   which leads me to   south park  on the other hand  was a lot more fun  throw in a sheep herder  a young mr  mackey  a random pizza delivery guy  and even a retired freddy kruger and you ve got an entertaining 22 minutes  and  of course  randy marsh  stan is trapped in mr  mackey s dream  so randy goes in to save him  stan sees his dad in the dream  but his dad has come into the dream as a butterfly  stan says  did you come here to help me   and randy replies  i was gonna   butterflies have no concern for these things  stan  i m gonna go find me some butterfly poon   so much better than watching inception,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.862506091594696, 'elapsed_time': 0.6328084468841553}",positive

only a very teeny spoiler   well  what can i say  inception was the most overrated movie i ve seen in years  the plot had more holes than a string vest i found the first 20 mins dull at best  and was easily distracted  i actually paused the film and ordered a pizza had a look at twitter read another message board      i even restarted the film to give it another chance  but to no avail then for a whole 20 mins  it managed to keep my attention before leaving me again thinking  why i am watching this   for the next hour or so  i finally gave in with 45 mins to go when it turned into a bond movie with snow skiing chases that appeared from nowhere i didn t give a toss about the characters who did nothing to make me want to care  the plot didn t fill more than a few minutes of the 145 mins i stayed with it and bar a few nice cgi tricks   i can t say there was anything not done better in other movies many times over and in a great deal less time give me total recall for dream based plots and action any day of the week the acting was average  the architect looked 17yrs old yet somehow became an instant expert in dreams psychology and managed to be smug   was she the token precocious child that all writers include when their stories are dying on the page  perhaps a cute pet dog would have helped here it isn t often that i switch a film off because i think its pointless to carry on  inception didn t even annoy me enough to see what happened at the end   i simply didn t care  how this is getting anything over a 6 10 is beyond me  i gave it a 4 10 and even then i think i m being generous   it didn t even score on the so bad it s good chart,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.0019877685699611902, 'elapsed_time': 0.40477895736694336}",negative
a film that starts with much promise and for the first half hour or so works well before descending into farce  the idea of being sent into someone s subconscious or dream state is fascinating but when it comes to the point that someone is sent into a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream it just becomes ridiculous and on this occasion it does not work  christopher nolan is a fine director screen writer with a tremendous back catalogue of movies and will no doubt add to this back catalogue with more gems as his career continues but inception is not one of them not a terrible movie but not a good one either  if you want to waste an hour and forty odd minutes of your time then go ahead and watch it but there are far better movies that exist,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.03258669748902321, 'elapsed_time': 0.38190388679504395}",negative

after reading all the amazing reviews and seeing a score of 9 3   3rd best movie of all time  i had to go watch inception  also i really like memento   it was such a cool  original movie  so i was looking forward to this i went to see this movie last weekend  it was an 11 00pm showing on sunday night  3 weeks after opening night and the theatre was packed  we had to sit in the second row   something i don t mind at all epic fail the movie is about corporate  not even government  spies  that enter people s dreams through some unexplained technology  once in the dream  they trick the victim into giving up his her secrets  pretty simple premise  and one that can be taken into many directions  after all we re in dreamland   well the direction is down the crapper the whole premise of the movie is so shallow  saito  a corporate ceo hires cobb  leo  to go into another ceo s dream and plant an idea of breaking up his fathers empire  upon his father s death   so that saito can have a monopoly  how s that for a story   what a joke well the movie starts slow and drags on and on  besides that there are so many plot holes and explaining of everything that happens  like they manipulate the victim by having a dream  within a dream  within a dream  when you are falling in the first dream  the second layer has no gravity  but the third and forth layer has gravity   whaaaa    also even though you are in a dream  you have no super powers  you use boring guns  how about shooting lighting bolts out your you know what   booorring to add to the boredom  cobb s wife mal killed herself because she thought she was dreaming  and appears regularly to bore us to death  you get the sense that she s supposed to be evil  but it never pans out this was interesting on one level only   there was no antagonist  but then again there was no love interest either  and on top of that no danger  cause if you get killed in a dream  all you do is wake up this movie is amoral tripe with no imagination  eg  you are in a dream world  instead of driving around in a van  why not fly  instead of shooting guns  why not freeze them in their tracks  also  there are many people  i assume teenagers  who are saying how original this movie is  the dream within a dream thing has been done before   it s called  a nightmare on elm street part 3  dream warriors   also don t ever compare this tripe to the  matrix   matrix was original  it was filled with clever allegory  it was truly awe inspiring  but there was nothing clever about inceptipon the climax was okay  but just because after 2 hours i couldn t wait to get out of there now the anti climax  is an entirely different animal  like the viewer hasn t been insulted enough   we are left to ponder weather it was  all a dream   again not very original   the answer is yes  it was all a dream  and cobb is still in a dream  his kids look exactly the same  even wearing the same clothes as his other dreams please do yourself a favour and do not pay to see this garbage  so far the best movie this summer has been predators   how sad  people think this movie is clever and original because they are teenagers  it probably is clever and original to them  but any adult will find this movie dull and boring inception   failimdb for having inception in your top 3 movies   epic fail if i was the credibility nazi  i d say to imdb  no credibility for you  2 10 for exploiting a big budget,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.036249030381441116, 'elapsed_time': 0.5988142490386963}",negative
inception  2 28  pg 13    9   science fiction  biggie  original2009 was an amazing year for sf f movies  with 7 original films  avatar  district 9  inglourious basterds  inkheart  star trek  up  and watchmen  getting my top rating of 9  2010 so far has been disappointing  with only 4  how to train your dragon  kick ass  shrek forever after  and toy story 3  getting as high as 8  but the dry spell is finally over  and in absolutely smashing fashion christopher nolan has a grand total of 9 films to his credit  but they include such outstanding productions as memento  2000   the prestige  2006   and the dark knight  2008   furthermore  in addition to directing  he co wrote the screenplays for those movies with his brother jonathan  they were marvels of intricacy  with layer upon layer of hidden meaning and nuance  slowly revealed as the story progressed  now  as solo screenwriter and director  he has produced a masterpiece  the mind blowing inception he takes an idea which i 1st read about in douglas hofstadter s pulitzer prize winning 1979 book gödel  escher  bach  an eternal golden braid  and turns it into a riveting drama  hofstadter wrote about a storyteller who gets his protagonist to a cliff hanger point in a story  then has him start telling another story  which in turn leads to its own crisis  and then again  and then again  after the crisis is resolved at the final  deepest level  we go up and up and up again  and finally out  only then does hofstadter call our attention to the fact that we went down 4 levels but only came back up for 3 of them nolan uses this same idea  along with some escherian visuals  with a wrinkle  it s not a story  it s a dream  and the dreamers are wired together so they share each others  experiences  furthermore  there s a time dilation effect  familiar to most people from their own dreams at least as far back as mark twain s  the great dark   in which an hour in dreamland is only 5 minutes in the real world  and if a person in dreamland goes into a deeper dream  the effect is compounded  so that a seeming lifetime can pass during only a short nap in the near future  a small coterie of researchers has gotten good at this  and they make some shady money extracting hidden memories from the subconscious of people whose dreams they invade  then a new proposition comes along  wealthy power company tycoon saito  ken watanabe  wants to do the opposite   not to retrieve a memory but to plant one in the mind of robert fischer jr   cillian murphy   the heir to the rival fischer morrow corp  dom cobb  leonardo dicaprio  is confident it can be done  despite the misgivings of the rest of his team  but he warns that it will require going down multiple layers  for 2 reasons   1  the new idea has to be so subtly insinuated that the target will think he came up with it himself  for reasons he would find credible  and  2  fischer has undergone training to resist this very kind of dream incursion  and his subconscious comes equipped with alarms and security guards to snap him out of any ordinary dream state but wait  there s more  normally  when you re  killed  in a dream  you just wake up  but this endeavor involves not merely multiple levels but also a powerful anesthetic  and the combination means that anyone  killed  in dreamland will stay there forever  in a kind of limbo  lost to reality and still more  cobb s dead wife mal  marion cotillard  shows up every time he enters dreamworld  whether he s the primary dreamer himself or piggybacking on someone else s  even tho she s just a figment of his imagination  he s got a really good imagination  and she has her own reasons for wanting to keep him in the dream state  so she s always trying to thwart his best laid plans  so cobb himself can t have too much knowledge  in his waking state  of whatever imaginary world they re planning to take the target into  but  while he recognizes this in himself and compensates for it  he has other blind spots that could endanger his entire team  fortunately  he s engaged the brilliant young architect ariadne  ellen page  to design his mazes for him  and she tumbles to some of his personal demons but wait  there s still moreand so it goes  layer upon layer  complexity atop complexity  and you start to think you shouldn t be able to tell the players without a scorecard  but somehow nolan gives you just enuf visual cues to help you keep straight at least 4 simultaneous story threads  as he intercuts rapidly between them it is a tour de force  the best sf f movie of the year  it s not for slow learners  but anyone who s easily bored will have absolutely no problem staying awake  indeed  after this  you may be reluctant to ever fall asleep again,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9742408394813538, 'elapsed_time': 0.5992884635925293}",positive
christopher nolan has undoubtedly become one of the most important names in the business of contemporary filmed entertainment he has taken us to places we did not know existed he singlehandedly revived a languishing cartoon franchise and placed it in the pantheon of unforgettable classics  in his new adventure he takes on the uncharted universe of the subconscious  the premise in its scope is intriguing and unconceivable ambitious he relies on the best movie making talent only a major movie studio can buy to achieve his goal the special effects are terrific  the acting is pretty good  and the dialogue is also good  but the journey that started as an unrestrained adventure into the realms of the human thought generating universe turned half way thru into a tale of semi confusing scenes  the story never comes anywhere near of seducing its audience  the emotional factor is completely absent the movie is worth watching and it does stand out mostly due to lack of quality competition  but it should not be an oscar nominee  christopher nolan has done better work,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9845741391181946, 'elapsed_time': 0.6325833797454834}",positive

this film follows cobb  a man who is payed to infiltrate peoples  subconscious through their dreams and extract information  he is hired by a man however to do the opposite  the impossible  to infiltrate a tycoon s subconscious and plant an idea instead of take one   known as inception this movie shattered my comprehension and mind a million times over  and the more i try and work it out  the crazier it gets  how on earth does chris nolans brain work  how to you conceive this script from nothing  a story so intricate  intellectual  complex and layered that simply watching it is mind bending  let alone writing it  the thought of sitting down and working through the labyrinth like story and characters is incredible daunting  every single facet of this film can be taken down a seemingly endless rabbit hole ive said this before  but now  truly  i can say  i have never seen anything like this  nolan has pushed the boundaries of storytelling and how it doesn t necessarily have to be transparent for an audience to grasp onto it  there is a plethora of things i couldn t comprehend while watching   but it honestly never took away from the film in general  it was never too convoluted that i became overwhelmed and uninterested  was i completely mind broken  scratching my head the entire time  yes  but i still was able to focus on the plot point at hand and be insanely immersed  it struck an incredible balance of being complex  but still allowing the viewer to be immersed in the moment and not in thought  you don t have to understand the science and logic of it to have the watch of your life   vaguely understanding the labyrinth of layers and depth is kind of what makes it incredible  i can understand the scope and scale of what nolan is doing  but i m not going to sit down and map it all out  what a premise for a film  and what a delivery amid the spiderweb of subconscious and dreams within dreams  there is a character i grabbed onto and empathized with  cobb is a broken widower  and it was fantastic learning about his trauma and wife piece by piece  we re guessing throughout at the entire picture of his past  but it is slowly  sometimes painfully unveiled to us with brilliant pacing  i was right there in those moments with cobb as he opens up to ariadne  or confronts his wife in the void  and the end  oh my god the end  he finally confronts his wife and the guilt he bears  giving us  the viewer  the final pieces of their story puzzle   catharsis man  catharsis  an incredible character and a heartbreaking story with high stakes attached  threatening to derail their mission i really like what cobbs story and the movie as a whole says in terms of our subconscious and trauma  cobb suppressed his emotions and guilt for so long they threatened to consume him  any mission he went on  anywhere he goes  he sees them  the memories and guilt threaten to derail his life at every turn  it is a beautiful sentiment toward these human emotions that so many people do not confront  everyone carries baggage and trauma which they must come face to face with  then let go  in order to get back  home   i feel like themes such as this are why this movie succeeded beyond its complex story   at the core its a character piece about past love  hurt and loss  and how we deal with it i only watched this last night  but i already know the ending will be engrained in my mind forever  it leaves a huge question asked all movie unanswered  and has a serious uncanny tone  i was so happy for cobb at the end  but that emotion quickly subsided as i watched the spinner  wide eyed and teary  what a mismatch of feelings to give your viewer on the closing frame   absolute perfection overall  inception is a film that cannot be replicated  and will forever be one of one  outstanding sci fi premise  inconceivable narrative depth  and a character crafted with heart  christopher nolan  you genius,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9955463409423828, 'elapsed_time': 0.2794532775878906}",positive
inception  has already been defined by its makers as a mixture of james bond and  the matrix   i was hoping that it would be more  and it was  but not as much as i would have liked it to be conceptually it was fascinating  dreams are fascinating in themselves  and the idea of being able to enter and manipulate the sub conscious has been around for awhile in movies   a nightmare on elm street    dreamscape    the cell   and  what dreams may come   the best of these is  the cell   which spins a horrific tale  yet  as a dream concept film it is the most visually interesting because it gives us the kind of abstractions that are associated with dreams  abstractions that can make sub conscious sense  particularly to the dreamer   inception  initially depicts some dream abstractions  but conveniently overrides this by introducing the  dream architect  whose job it is to make the dream as real as possible as a result  as our actors jump through dream levels  in which there are four  psychology has determined there are primarily two sub conscious levels  we observe commonsensical realities   for the most part  although this is significant to storyline development  it unfortunately means that we are left with familiar visuals  chase scenes and shoot em  ups  that merely differ from level to level  soon we find ourselves watching two to four recognizable action scenarios that are implied to be transpiring simultaneously since this can present the possibility of confusion for the viewer  the film often becomes visually redundant and subsequently monotonous  this was the major flaw of the film  so much so that i almost nodded off  myself yet  the concept of the film overrides this flaw  and much of the imagery is particularly stunning,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9893844723701477, 'elapsed_time': 0.27971816062927246}",positive

after all the hype and marketing that built up before the release of this film i decided to leave it a week before seeing it  sitting in a crowded cinema with hundreds of wannabe intellectuals who will immediately  and loudly  begin to dissect the film as soon as the credits roll doesn t appeal to me i ve heard that inception is a  mindf     and a film that requires more than one viewing to fully understand  well  i never found it to be that way  not that i am showing off  but i found it rather straight forward in the sense that it goes from a z  but the entire alphabet in between is completely jumbled and anyone the slightest bit attentive can put it in the right order rather easily is it well made and flawlessly shot  definitely  i think that wally pfister is long overdue for an oscar and his cinematography on this film should secure him that award  the acting  while competent  left me cold though  i never really felt anything for the characters  they were far too distant and deadly serious  it reminded me of the matrix  a very similar film  with the heavy exposition and surreal physics  inception is all about spectacle and epic visuals  that s not a real criticism though  the scope and sights are worth the price of a ticket alone the dream manipulation theme has been around for decades and it didn t impress me as anything breathtakingly new  hans zimmer borrows from his own dark knight score a bit too liberally  though there are some ingenious sounds in there  so   while many  many people are praising this film to the point of possible mass hysteria i have to point out that there isn t that much original about it a bold  confident work  and consistently gripping  but no one will blame you if you have a feeling of deja vu  even the final shot is similar to the ending of a certain paul verhoeven film from 1990  is it a dream or is it reality it s been done before if you want a film that truly messes with your head check out david lynch s inland empire or lost highway,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9321975708007812, 'elapsed_time': 0.16640090942382812}",positive

whilst christopher nolan s inception is superior in almost all respects to his previous film  the dark knight  it s still a portentous  pretentious concept in search of a story  whilst that concept is a clever one  the film is  as are all nolan features  seriously over plotted and far too long  with one dimensional cardboard characters slotted into position to help prove the director s point about the malleability of reality it s impossible to give a damn about any of the people involved  and the  corporate espionage  angle generates little more than a shrug of disinterest  who cares whether or not some fictional corporation gets broken up or not  leonardo dicaprio does his best to bring some emotional weight to the table  but nolan s screenplay doesn t have much room for genuine feeling  there are good performances by joseph gordon levitt and tom hardy  but ellen page is atrocious  how long can the woman in the body of a thirteen year old girl schtick work    whilst marion cottilard is little better  and whoever came up with the idea of using edith piaf s non je ne regrette rien as a triggering device should have been fired  of course  it was probably mr  nolan himself inception is not a complete waste of time  and it s nice to see a summer blockbuster rely less on explosions and more on matters of the heart and mind  but it s far from a must see,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.043601322919130325, 'elapsed_time': 0.16483569145202637}",negative
alright  so here s the thing  yes  it was cool that there was all that complexity  yes  it was cool that there were so many layers of thought both on screen and off to what was going on  yes  it was cool that chris nolan managed to make something unique and fairly independent in just one movie that was complex enough to account for a whole trilogy of movies in almost any other genre  but here s the thing  it had some rather alarming logical leaps that i could not get over 1 the projections  okay  so the things that inhabit the streets of the person s subconscious are manifestations of the various components of their brain as evidenced by the fact that when the characters need to find something out about the dreamer s perception of someone else they just follow that manifestation in the dream  makes sense  because that thought does what the dreamer thinks it would do  not what the real person would do  when i saw that i went  wow  that makes sense  clever    but then towards the end of the movie they say  nevermind  they re just projections  they don t actually mean anything  and parts of their minds aren t being killed   that was a little too convenient for my liking 2 the totems  why doesn t the top fall over in the dream world  why does it keep spinning perpetually  everything else obeys the laws of basic physics  so why wouldn t that  that was probably the dumbest thing i ve seen in a movie this year  there wasn t even an attempt made to explain it  i can honestly say this was just as bad as  only a prime can kill a prime  in trasformers 2 3  the architect dreamer relationship  why can only the architect choose the world they enter  and why is the only person who  projects  characters into this world the person that s  the dreamer   they are all dreaming  every single one of them  so they should all be both altering the world they re in and the characters in it  and why can t the projections do anything cooler than be normal guys with guns  if i detected intruders in my mind i d summon a nuke or godzilla or optimus prime to get them out  not boring henchman who probably wouldn t be able to get the job done anyways 4  the script  and it s supposed  surprises  i felt kind of talked down to when they honestly expected it to be a surprise when you discovered that molly s death was as a result of cobb s previous inception  if anyone made it through that movie without figuring that out they deserve to be jettisoned into the sun for their stupidity  i caught on the moment he mentioned that inception was possible 5  waking up dying in the dream when you die in the dream world you come back up a level towards consciousness  as evidenced by the fact that they wake up when they get shot in the face in the first scene  but wait  when they die in the dream you actually go down to limbo as evidenced by that happening to the oriental guy  which sucks because that s where it s just  pure subconscious  and you wake up a vegetable  but wait  you actually aren t in an endless limbo because cobb and molly went there once  but you still wake up a vegetable  but wait  you actually don t wake up a vegetable because cobb and molly didn t when they killed themselves on the train tracks  but limbo is still bad       right  because you can t get out without becoming mentally handicapped  but if you can kill yourself to get out at any time just like a normal dream then why is limbo even bad  and isn t inertia supposed to wake you up  technically the van falling off the bridge should have woken them up  or even it rolling  not it hitting the water  if the force of hitting the water is what woke them up  then shouldn t anything like a slap to the face do it in the end the movie suffered from the exact same things the dark knight did  and that is chris nolan s conflicting desires to make something believable and for sensationalism  and both cancelling out the other  if you wanted to compare it to the other obvious similar franchise the matrix actually is believable  oh  yeah  now that i think of the matrix  how does a tiny needle plugged into their wrist plug them into an alternate reality in inception  the base of the skull made sense  this is just silly  people keep saying this is the next matrix  but the difference here is that literally twenty views later everything in the matrix still makes sense  and i punched holes in this latest leonardo decrapio movie in one sitting  pathetic,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.0079658143222332, 'elapsed_time': 0.16998648643493652}",negative

what s the most resilient parasite  an idea  a single idea from the human mind can build cities  an idea can transform the world and rewrite all the rules  which is why i have to steal it   that is the motto of  inception   it is a very intriguing idea in itself  but one which the film only goes superficially to explore  to cover for this superficiality  the plot is given a superficially complex guise  but actually it s pretty straightforward leonardo dicaprio and his team invade people s dreams to steal information from their subconscious  however  their new mission in  inception  is not to steal information  bur rather to  plant  it  therefore causing the inception of a new idea in the target s subconscious  to do this  they form dreams within dreams  which in the film actually work as three separate dreams rather than actual dreams within dreams   therefore accessing a more vulnerable form of the target s subconscious for some reason  which the film doesn t adequately explain  within the dream there is a symbol of the subconscious motive  say  a safe  whereas you can find the desired information  or whereas you can plant the desired information  but there s a catch  if for some reason you  die  in a dream within a dream  you remain in subconscious limbo  which again is not adequately explained  which nevertheless can resemble a form of reality in itself amidst all that  christopher nolan makes an action film  with car chases  gunshots etc etc here is the thing with nolan  as a director he only offers intrigue  he approaches an ambitious idea  touches the surface of it  but then hesitates to proceed any further  and reverts to the action film prototype  furthermore  he has done it so many times already  that even the action segments look pompous and clichéd  too much reliance on editing and warping of real time  this is a confused film  which tries to hide it s inadequacies in a needlessly confusing plot once again with a nolan film  ambiguity prevails  when dicaprio and his wife are stuck in subconscious limbo  the wife  locks  the idea of doubting an objective reality  and throws away the key  dicaprio invades her subconscious and replants the idea  thus when they re enter real life the idea remains  but the idea was there in the first place  wasn t it  the sub plot with robert fischer is stated in such a way so that it impresses with it s artificial  complexity   in the first  layer  of dream  dicaprio s team plant seeds of doubt  in the second layer of dream they direct fischer into facing this doubt  and in the third layer of dream he faces it  duh   but it is suggested that the seeds of fischer s discomfort were already rooted in real life  with dicaprio s team merely fast forwarding them  hence ambiguity again   the icing on the cake is we never learn whether dicaprio has returned to real life or not  ambiguity  what a mess  the only thing this multiple dream architecture serves is that it spices up what is essentially a simple plot  that somebody enters someone s dream in order to plant an idea  that s all there is to it as it is  ambiguity characterizes christopher nolan very nicely  as he seems eternally torn between the commercial action film and   something else  without that  something else  ever taking shape   nolan must stop hinting at a grander scope and actually embrace it,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9840684533119202, 'elapsed_time': 0.26580214500427246}",positive

terrible film  there are way better iterations of dream films than this  mulholland dr  by david lynch is one of them like some others have posted around the web  it was too long  and too confusing  not that there was any depth or cleverness to the film  too much repetition  they kept  trying  to explain everything over and over again it was just a stream of hollywood trash  didn t really seem like any of the subjects were dreaming at all  just explosions and dumb dialogue  with shallow characters and a convoluted storyline spoiler alert   the film is a film about a man  leonardo    an architect  who falls asleep on a plane in first class  it s a long flight to la  so the movie shows what he is dreaming about during that time that he is asleep on that flight  the only real part of the film is when he wakes up at the end in the plane  he looks around  sees a cabin full of people in first class  then gets off the plane  and goes home with michael caine  either his father  grandfather  or caretaker for his two children the people in first class were in his dream because he saw them in the cabin before he fell asleep  they then each took on a part in his dreaming  but none of them have any connection to his real life  and no  he is not a thief  he is not hired by some black corporation to extract information from people through dreaming  there is nothing of the sort  the movie is just a dream supporting evidence 1  first  the movie is just shallow trash  horrible illustration of a dream film just down to its core  it s so bad that it is obvious how hard they tried to make it look like a dream 2  reference to architects    a dream architect is simply what leonardo is in real life  an architect 3  projection    they must have said projection 100 times  it s obvious that the movie is telling you that leonardo is just projecting his own subconscious onto the others in his dream  this is the only part of the movie that is decent academically  the fact that the filmmakers understand what psychological projection is  but also  the fact that they repeated the concept of projection so many times it just lost its value  anyway  leonardo projects his wants  fears  and desires  in a convoluted way  onto the other subjects  for example   fischer  takes on his own self in relation to his father  also  the girl who keeps telling him to move on is another projection of his own mind telling himself to move on from his wife s death   the movie progresses and gets ever more deeper into leonardo s subconscious  where the root of his anxiety resides  he finally discovers that it is ok for him to be his own man  to be an architect  and not try to live up to what his father was  so we have a set of problem s  that reveal themselves ever so slightly as the dream progresses  in the form of leonardo projecting his fears  etc  onto other subjects  until he goes so deep as to arrive at a place where he has a feeling it is really about him  like a sort of solution  but like anything  the problems need to be apparent before a solution can be revealed  dreaming is like this  your mind weaves together a series of experiences  and projections  and if you understand them enough  you ll know what the problems really are  and you can then begin working on a solution in real life   he then wakes up  reality is there  it was a cathartic release 4  the dream sharing    there is no literal dream sharing  getting into the minds of others and extracting their thoughts  this is a metaphor    the movie is telling us that there are a group of people in a small area  cabin of a plane  who are all dreaming    and they may have a bit of a spiritual connection to each other    so one person feeling anxious  another may  feel  this while dreaming and some sort of shared experience results  it s a bit of a play on the idea that people can dream together and sort of experience similar or even the same things  but that s pseudo science and mostly fiction 5  recurring nightmare about his wife  obviously this is another clear marker that it is just a dream  his recurring nightmare about his wife  looks like she killed herself  perhaps jumped out of a hotel room window because leonardo didn t show up for their anniversary  perhaps he was not a good husband and wasn t around enough    he then blamed himself  the girl in the film kept telling him to move on   so leonardo s major life issues were revealed in a convoluted way within a long dream  like any human being  those issues are complex  the ending showed how he seemed relieved when he got home to see his kids  it looks like it was a very important dream because it pushed him over a threshold and helped him to realize a set of things to make his life better also  can we please stop with all the discussion about the tenability of the things seen in the film  most of it won t make much sense  it was just a dream  therefore  defying gravity  ending up in different stages of life so quickly  etc     it all makes sense when understood from the perspective that  it  was  just  a  dream now  after such a lengthy review and explanation  you might be wondering why i only gave it 1 star  i ll end how i started  it s hollywood trash  too basic  too stupid  too obvious  and to someone how dreams every night  and the fact that there are way better films about dreaming out there

i would have honestly given the movie a 7 but the current rating is very undeserving and i had no choice but to make the least contribution i could make to it  the writer director of inception thought if maybe they pretended to have a very complex plot and great special effects  the audience would not realize how pointless the whole story is  the audience were like   oh  such a complex plot  a genius   a masterpiece    the first hour and a half all they do is explain the whole inception system without moving the plot forward  i am sure most of the audience didn t get what the movie was about but they pretended so they would not look stupid  and christopher nolan is going  i don t really think of films in terms of light and dark   blah blah blah  i am a genius  blah blah blah     thriller that takes place in the mind   blah blah blah  i am a genius  blah blah blah   the intention of the film clearly reflected on itself  the point was not to entertain audience but rather it was a show off of what artistic capability the director writer possesses  it tried to point out the fact what a movie genius christopher nolan is  i mean i love this guy  the prestige was great and so was the dark knight  but inception was really showing off  look at kick ass  watchmen and scott pilgrim vs  the world  they were complete honest movies  their intentions were clean and they reflected in the movie  they were meant for pure entertainment and that s what we got  on the other hand inception was trying too hard  i could really point the fact on how the intentions of the movie was showing off but i would rather suggest the audience to watch the movie once again  they said the movie was very unpredictable  suppose there is a man chopping onions in the movie and suddenly the chopped onions turned into a chicken  now would that be predictable  they might say cobb s wife living with him till old age in the dream was unpredictable  are you serious   how come you haven t seen that one coming   it was so obvious  it is only the fact the way it was dramatized that made it seem unpredictable and shocking  top 10 in the imdb chart    are you kidding me,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.0810103565454483, 'elapsed_time': 0.277850866317749}",negative
i will try not to repeat some of what others have so brilliantly written in some reviews  i just add this in order to contradict the hype that has allowed this movie to be ranked so high in imdb  the same has been happening with other movies  and that is a shame for imdb  which is becoming unreliable i want to stress the fact that the only complexity in this movie is trying to figure out how you can invest so much money in a script that continuously makes a fool of the average critic intelligent viewer  the story is not complex  it is deliberately confusing in order to conceal its stupidity  nothing that really matters is explained in the movie and there s so many embarrassing clichés  the recruiting of the team  the episode in mombassa  the assault of the ice fortress  many of the action sequences     the average viewer must be disappointed and the dreams   which serve as the scenario to most of the movie   are populated by the utmost lack of imagination finally  there s the score  louder and louder  building a suspense that is never there  for everything is a dream  and we do not quite catch what there is exactly that can go wrong   well  all in all  the movie is an insult to the average intelligent viewer and  having been directed by christopher nolan  an ultimate disappointment,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.018798651173710823, 'elapsed_time': 0.2523009777069092}",negative

was it worth the wait    no i find it difficult to find anything positive to say  but the premise and idea of the film is interesting 
that sadly is all  its an overblown mess of a movie with no place for a connection to the films characters 
a collection of choreographed fight scenes connected by dream science mumbo jumbo and accompanied by a bombastic score does not make an interesting movie 
mr nolan should have spent his time focusing on a coherent story and some character development  less time on trying to shoehorn in pointless action a bitter dissapointment of a movie","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.006568893790245056, 'elapsed_time': 0.1995081901550293}",negative
as long as it remains possible to spend 100 million dollars on making drivel  setting aside 10 million towards advertising in order to tell people that it s great so that they ve spent 200 million on tickets before they find out otherwise  there ll be no incentive for hollywood movie making ever to improve i ve reviewed angelina jolie s latest farrago in very similar terms  while that movie bizarrely assumes that the cold war still remains of interest to anyone       inception  insists basically that it s interesting to watch other people s dreams  well  visually it can be   the  architecture bending  style of  inception  would have had great appeal  maybe in a 60 second advert for a credit card or mobile phone company but visual appeal aside  the  plot  of the movie is not so much multi layered as multi  pointless  the old cliché that  if you die in dream you wake up  is hauled out here with monotonous regularity  but it s never applied consistently  and even if it were  who cares  if you must fire a machine gun at someone in a dream  and i can t think of any reason why you d really need to   why would you ever run out of bullets  wouldn t you just dream up some more  if you want to blow up a dream hotel  do you really need dream explosives  if the fuse goes out  is it safe to return  or should you always light the dreamy blue touchpaper and stand well back the movie s makers assume that multi layering these various dream levels will be endlessly fascinating  as evidenced by the enormous running time   but anyone with an ounce of discernment will simply become less and less connected as the plot becomes  deeper  we re in the same childish  ill conceived territory here as many movies about existing in  virtual reality  or even  on the holodeck   simulate as convincingly as you like  but you can t change the laws of physics in the real world  and if you re in a dream  then there s no real need to worry about being stabbed or shot  and neither should the viewer care whether the characters are  or aren t the urban myth being put about that  inception  includes some sort of interesting or unexpected ending is no more than that for a witty  snappy meditation on alternative reality  try cronenberg s  existenz   and  despite the fact that  like  when you re dreaming you know  your life goes really slowly and  like  you can live a whole lifetime in the dreamy dream state  man  try to give this bloated waste of time a miss,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.026297064498066902, 'elapsed_time': 0.17136192321777344}",negative

christopher nolan has done some great work his ideas and direction singlehandedly gave new life to the beloved superhero batman while the film dark knight will always be recognized to the new dimensions it added to the classic batman series of movies and comics  inception was nothing more than a dull and linear plot  surrounded by and an even duller and more linear plot the centerpiece of this movie was supposed to be its convoluted storyline which was scattered across multiple levels  in essence puzzle that forces the viewer to think through the movie and decipher the ending the concept of  levels  and or  interconnected plots  worked very well for such great films such as the matrix  2001 a space odyssey  logan s run  or total recall  inception not only miserably fails at this but it also lacks in other places as well  characters  great actors  whom have all done great work in many movies spanning decades  however the characters in this movie came off as neutered eunuchs who lacked sense  emotion  and any sort of cohesiveness   sir michael caine and tom berenger s performances were appalling and the  team  of dreamers lacked screen dynamics and chemistry   action  for a dream world  the action in this movie is very unimaginative and is well within the typical hollywood bounds  car cash scenes where the heroes drive and shoot  building shootouts  and melodramatic bullet wounds  as always one character is wounded critically  the team must save him  however the character can still  fight    plot  this movie could have easily been over within 1 hour of rolling  not only was inception s  puzzle ending  blatantly obvious 40 mins into the film  but the storyline it self lacked any substance or draw  the overly complicated  puzzle piece  effect which nolan was trying to achieve  was nothing more than the main story line being surrounded by excessive fluff and whimsical bullplop  i will credit the movie with one notable mention  nolan managed to work a matrix style fight scene  which have been overdone by hollywood since the early 2000s  into the small confines of an elevator in the ending  inception is not the great rave that many make it out to be  while the movie takes place in a  dream world   where bounds are limitless  the movie itself is sterile  cliché  repetitive  and unimaginative  this is even further compounded by one dimensional characters  and a drawn out storyline that pretends to be an enigma perhaps christopher nolan s true intent was to make a sterile and lack luster movie aimed strictly at making today s self absorbed and obtuse facebook hipster generation feel  smart  inception can be compared to a class presentation where the student is unprepared  to hide this  the student uses convoluted and circular logic to stammer through the presentation and pass the time  it is obvious that the student knows nothing and has wasted several minutes talking about a subject that could have been explained in seconds  nonetheless  since the student used  big words   talked excessively  and is deemed to be in the  mainstream  the class gives a standing ovation regardless,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.33841556310653687, 'elapsed_time': 0.1516425609588623}",negative
i was really looking forward to watching this movie after all the positive reviews  the incredibly high imdb rating and the raving of several friends who had seen it i will point out that i liked the matrix  memento  batman begins and the dark knight  although this last movie is quite overrated on imdb   i also understood the plot of inception from the start and never had any trouble following what was happening so it s not that i didn t  get it  inception is not a great movie and not even a very good one  the plot is not very clever or inventive contrary to what many imdb raters have suggested and there are no interesting or surprising twists the characters are poorly developed and  as the viewer  i didn t really care what happened to them  there are no true  bad guys  to root against  all the bad guys are just  bad  dreams  and there is no real desire to see the  good guys  succeed because the object of the entire plot seems irrelevant  implant a thought in some guy s head so he will break up his father s corporation    i kid you not   the fact that everything happens in dreams removes the sense of danger and risk from all the action and makes it seem like a pointless video game  which is what several of the dreams appear to be anyway    unimaginative and repetitive  are all nolan s dreams just  shoot em up  video games  the attack of the hospital mountain fortress was as bad as it gets    looked like a cgi sequence from medal of honor call of duty it was also infuriating to me that the rules of the dream universes are inconsistent  creating an imaginary situation where normal rules don t apply is ok as long as the alternate universe functions according to logical rules  but in this movie the rules are constantly bent to accommodate the needs of the director a few examples the top is supposed to be an indication to mal that she is in  her own dream  if the top spins forever because she has made it that way    if she is in someone else s dream then the top will topple since they don t know that in her dreams the top spins forever  so how does that indicate to dom the viewer that he is is not in a dream reality in the end scene     but wow  that is sooo deep how did finding the top in the safe allow dom to  incept  mal with the idea that she was in a dream and needed to return to reality  no explanation    but wow  that is sooo deep in dream no 1 the van falls off the bridge causing weightlessness in dream no 2   meaning that non physical events  it s a dream  of a certain kind    carry through between dream layers  in dream no 2 the sleeping characters become weightless but somehow this state does not carry through to layer no 3 and no 4    but it s a dream anyway so who cares if it makes sense why do you need a  kick  in each layer to wake up the characters  if weightlessness carries through the layers the  kick  would logically also carry through    if there was some logic to the rule wouldn t it be that only actual physical events in the real world carry through to the dreams  but in your dream you are aware that there is another reality   which is really another dream   so you dream that can feel the effects of the other dream although you are asleep and unaware of what s going on    but wow  that is sooo deep if a character is asleep in the first layer of a dream he does not know what is happening to him after he has fallen asleep thus would have no reason to dream that he is becoming weightless in layer two as he sleeps through the falling van dream    but wow  that is sooo deep since the wake up  kicks  are supposed to come through sensation in the inner ear and the  kicks  are not real but dreams  then i have to conclude that the inner ear must  dream  that it senses the imaginary kicks  which makes no sense at all    but wow  that is sooo deep so as you analyze the logic behind the dream rules you must conclude that the entire movie is just a dream  a nightmare  where no logic applies or that the  dream rules  are just nonsense and the whole movie is a pretext for stringing together a bunch of unrelated  cool  action sequences and special effects to make a massive hollywood  pseudo intellectual  blockbuster junk movie this movie was an even the greater disappointment considering that i was anticipating something better than  the matrix  or  the sixth sense   the imdb rating of 9  is incomprehensible  this should rate in the 6 0 7 0 range  the rating must reflect a large number of users getting confused and rating it as a video game as for those who say the number of positive votes reviews indicate it is a great movie i think you could likewise argue for mcdonald s being the best food in the world i rated it a very harsh 1 0 only to help bring the imdb rating back to earth  it is however a very mediocre movie,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7410331964492798, 'elapsed_time': 0.15018677711486816}",positive

like many people anxious to watch inception  i spent many hours online reading news  watching trailers  and just sharing my enthusiasm about it  then i began reading weird rumours about the film involving time travelling  it doesn t  and other potential spoilers  and i decided it was time to get away from the hubbub and wait for it in isolation  i wanted to watch the film as purely as possible  i only allowed myself one treat  i didn t resist listening to my beloved hans zimmer s score in advance  i never imagined my feelings about the music would reflect my feelings about the film  i expected an exquisite delicacy and instead got a steak with fries  and afterwards i was still hungry by now word of mouth has taken all the secrecy away from the story  so let s be brief about it  leonardo dicaprio plays dom cobb  the leader of a criminal crew that infiltrates the minds of people during their sleep to steal their ideas and sell them  after a botched assignment  cobb and his partner  arthur  joseph gordon leavitt   are hired by saito  ken watanabe  to do the reverse  instead of stealing an idea  they must implant an idea in a victim s subconscious  implant it so deeply that he won t doubt it came from himself  the victim is robert fischer  cillian murphy   the heir of an energetic mega conglomerate that threatens to have monopoly over half the world s energy supply  the idea is to convince him to dismantle this empire  for this epic assignment cobb hires the architect ariadne  ellen page   the forger eames  tom hardy  and the chemist yusuf  dileep rao  inception has the best ensemble cast i ve seen so far this year  that doesn t mean it has the best acting   i think that honour still goes to shutter island  which had heartbreaking performances by ben kingsley and dicaprio himself  but the viewer can be sure that a film that contains all the talent mentioned above plus marion cottilard plus cameos by michael caine  lukas haas  tom berenger and pete postlethwaite  is at least captivating on account of all the charisma walking in and out of the screen every two seconds i think the film needs all this charisma to satisfy because it doesn t offer much else in terms of entertainment  one of the greatest crimes a film that takes place in dreams within dreams within dream within dreams  yes  you counted it right   can be accused of is being visually dull  anyone who saw the trailer has nothing else to look forward to  it s all there  the zero gravity hallway fight scene  the city folding  the snow power station attack  the collapsing urban landscapes  the film only expands on the trailer  it has no other impressive scene  any artist worth his salt only uses dreams as a theme if he wants to show something visually interesting  dreams aren t held by physical laws  they re limitless  strange  threatening  in christopher nolan s world  however  i can see stranger dreams if i just look outside my window christopher nolan is not a particularly inventive filmmaker  there s no visual exuberance in his films  i noticed this when he turned gotham city  a wonderfully gothic and oppressive landscape in the batman comic books  into a replica of any american city  midas  touch turns things into gold  but nolan s touch turns uniqueness into banality  not even dreams are safe from him  defenders will rise to say that the realism of the dreams is the point  but then why dreams  who makes a film about mozart to ignore his music  many will also say that inception is a strange film  that s arguable  of course  it s ambiguous enough to allow several interpretations  but it makes sense most of the time  good writing and good editing contribute to that  i think this is also what made nolan s previous attempt at a mind boggling film  the prestige  so satisfying  he s a fair director  he takes time to show everything the viewer needs to know to understand what s going on  and the film s rhythm is slow  inception is strange in the sense that other mainstream  but quirkier than average  films are called strange  like the imaginarium of dr  parnassus or eternal sunshine of the spotless mind  it s strange in a very limited way  custom made for audiences that have been deprived of strangeness for so long that they can t recognise it anymore  it s a strangeness that hardly brings dignity to the true strangeness unleashed by wojciech has  the hourglass sanatorium or jan svankmajer s faust this banality applies even to the action  there are directors who ve revolutionised the way action is filmed  john woo  the wachowski brothers  even michael bay  but inception  with the exception of the inventive hallway fight scene  leaves much to be desired  car chases and gun fights play out much the way we expect  with little elegance or imagination inception s saving grace is that  for an action thriller  the main character is far more complex and engaging than usual  cobb is a man tormented by past horrors  separated from his children  running away for a crime he didn t commit  when he enters dreams his subconscious takes the form of his dead wife  mal  cottilard   always ready to foil his plans  cobb isn t just a cool thief but a man trying to get his life back and dicaprio makes him effortlessly sympathetic i don t know why  but i feel bad for not liking inception more  cinema certainly needs ambitious films that mix intellect with action  that dare to be unique while being familiar  inception is a respectable failure  in my view  but is a step in the right direction  i hope at least it inspires other filmmakers to move in the same direction,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9918196797370911, 'elapsed_time': 0.23681879043579102}",positive
christopher nolan s disappointing follow up to the dark knight has an intriguing enough premise  it s just a pity the man himself couldn t have settled for a  story by  credit and let someone else   perhaps his brother    take up the quill and ink  because the only respite we get from the barrage of exposition occurs during one of the many exciting  imaginative action sequences   the cliff side finale is not among them  sadly   perhaps nolan wanted to make absolutely sure that the audience knew what was at stake by the time the corridors started to flip and the subconscious snow started tumbling down the mountain  even his symbolism is spelled out  lest we miss a moment of the craftsman s genius  it s like watching tarkovsky with the writer s commentary blaring over the top as you may or may not  or even wish to  know  the plot involves a moody widower  leonardo dicaprio  and his team of wall street extras infiltrating the subconscious of the son  cillian murphy  of a wealthy businessman  pete postlethwaite   being a self proclaimed mind bender doesn t excuse the series of convolutions that puts the team at actual risk  but suffice to say  down this deep we re pretty much in the wes craven school of dying in your sleep  or near enough leonardo dicaprio is at his spitting best  joseph gordon levitt is wasted on action duties  michael caine is    oh no  he s gone  marion cotillard screams like a cat  tom hardy shines for me  the most disappointing aspect lies in the fact that this is a dream film without a single  solitary dream like image  nothing uncanny  eerie  unsettling or psychologically askew  perhaps this is how nolan dreams   in solidly defined  levels   with straight lined origami cities  empty of metaphor or oneiric imagery  nolan s dreamscape is a pristine museum  carefully and verbosely labelled  occasionally confusing  but not in a fun way  ultimately nothing more than a playground for confident men in tailored suits,"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.578781247138977, 'elapsed_time': 0.19022464752197266}",neutral

this movie is way too talky and confusing to enjoy  add to that a director writer with absolutely zero sense of humor and wit  and we are left with this dry onslaught on your senses  i think mr nolan may have brains and be some people s cup of tea  but his humorless and emotionless films have all left me extremely disappointed  inception in particular was torture for me  there is absolutely no payoff by the end of the film because we do not care about any of these characters  if it were not for the genius score  this could easily be the worst waste of time i have had in a movie theater in years i see there is some controversy and speculation as to where all the rave reviews are coming from  it s possible that there are many who do love this film  but they weren t in our packed audience  one person clapped at film s end  and it quickly died when no one joined in  instead most people bolted for the doors after this overlong dud,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.0030927176121622324, 'elapsed_time': 0.23780345916748047}",negative
well  i have to agree with this site  which came up when i was searching for inception   inception  wins informal poll as most overrated movie of 2010   i just don t get it  this is what i saw  fortunately for only  4 99 on on demand  great special effects  but mostly in the beginning of the movie an interesting psychological plot about manipulating a guy s mind an incredibly long middle sequence where one guy is moving around unconscious bodies  interspersed with equally incredibly boring scenes of shooting and fighting on a mountain   why in the world was all that necessary  without the hour or more spent on this totally unnecessary footage  it would be have been a much better movie  we almost killed ourselves when they showed the first shot of the van and it had just started falling  i guess the director took the idea of 5 minutes real time 1 hour dream time painfully literally a plot with a guy and his wife that is  spoiler alert  totally predictable if you saw shutter island or memento  or took psych 101 a cast that acted reasonably well  but whose characters i didn t care at all about so i don t get why it s so popular  i think i would have liked it a lot more if it had been ruthlessly edited down to an hour and a half  and if the wife plot had been something different for a change  i m getting tired of that one i know i ll get a lot of screaming comments from fans who don t believe anyone should have a different opinion than they do  but i d like to see anyone justify that long middle sequence,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.009397267363965511, 'elapsed_time': 0.22486162185668945}",negative
i must admit that the first time i saw inception  i was surprised  it is after all a complex movie  however after repeated views i ve realized that even though complex  it is not focused at all by now  most of the people reading this review already saw the movie and as the high rating on imdb reveals  most of the readers liked the movie  and in all honesty the first time or two times i saw it i liked it too  but as i said before repeated views  reveal the incoherent  pretentious  even ridiculous defects of the movie the main one  and my biggest complaint  being the   main plot   of the movie  completely amoral  simple and without depth nor real development  there is no reason at all for the viewer to root for the main cast  when they are ruining one guy s life just or the sake of helping other to make more money  the   heroes   are anti heroes or just true villains  they are thieves  criminals and the only redeeming quality  that is cob s  dicaprio s character  wish to see his children again  is in the end just a dream  an illusion  i don t think that every movie should have a heavy load of morals  however including true redeeming qualities adds depth and layers to the script and the characters  here we have 1 dimensional characters that spit lines of dialog without truly adding something to the plot  just for the sake of making the   heist movie   more interesting  and one last thing  shame on you mister nolan for bringing such great actors like tom berenger and especially michael caine to recite 3 lines in the entire movie  shame on you 1 10 and that s because i cannot put a 0 on it  yes the technical aspects of the movie are superb  however not even that saves this movie  unlike avatar  that the visuals  do carry the whole movie,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.004390637390315533, 'elapsed_time': 0.20239043235778809}",negative
i am probably one of the few who did not like this movie  i like chris nolan as a director  i liked _memento_  _batman begins_  and i loved his rendering of _the dark knight_  the problem i have with this movie is two fold  first  dreams are not like the way they are depicted in this film  in dreams  you are not conversing with other individuals about highly technical subjects  in this movie s dream sequences  the characters are continuously explaining what s happening  and what s going to happen  and they are involved in the complex programming for the next level of the dream  in other words  the characters think  act  and behave as if they are not in a dream at all  it s a lot of exposition   really  a whole lot   and in my experience  dreams are just not like that  yes things happen in dreams  and yes there are plenty of visual and auditory sensations   but i ve never had a dream where someone gave me a 15 minute detailed technical explanation of what was going to happen next  i guess i wanted the dream sequences to be  well  more dream like secondly  leo s ill fated romance just seemed to go nowhere  every time that story thread comes up   the pace of the movie freezes  leo has a way of delivering his lines very earnestly and urgently   and that s great and usually works well  as in _the departed_  but if the script is weak   it just comes off as annoying and phony  i m not sure what could replace the love interest thread   but it really hurt the movie in my opinion  i liken it to the relationship between anakin and padme in _star wars  attack of the clones_   the second sw prequel   although that love interest was even harder to bear i think the idea behind _inception_ is great and original   but those two issues sank it for me,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9506548047065735, 'elapsed_time': 0.21257567405700684}",positive
here s the rub  although i am astounded by the layering  scene and editing logistics and other details of the movie  the experience left me underwhelmed the are so much information to take in  more than usual for your average that while there are down times  i ll come back to this  they are not enough   and felt rush for a 2 5 hr movie  i wouldn t mind 3hr  maybe better yet as a series     or a book even   and yet the focusing character is cobb  a veteran of the trade  rather than the new comer   ellen page s character  so you must pick up concepts like extraction  inception  dream times  totem  kicker  limbo in a hurry without laying any significant weight to these concepts  especially in the scene on limbo  mind you the movie repeats these to you   in earnest plot line no less this is one information overloaded action movie  but then there s action loaded on top in the 3rd act  which i found unnecessary or set at the wrong location as one of the character explained it  this is a concept movie  and should have stayed that way   use words  use dramatic pauses  use ideas   such that the sequence in discussing and finalizing the wording of the inception concept felt dry  washed over  had no sense of   achievement    added and i ll be darn that a friend mention this kind of plot hole   knowing how ambiguous the ending is  but yet clearly stately throughout the first 1 2 of the film that the  wife  character is so much of a risk  it was a wash over in the end how dicaprio s character brushes off and not struggle a bit more       thinking back  memento  prestige and dark knight in their own right were better in terms of pacing  tempo change  and focus  although even dark knight had a issue of who s the lead   batman or joker   but i understand the juxtapose of the 2   starts off bat  changed to joker mid way  then change back  and the back story for cobb   kind of cliché      you see it coming,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.2110474854707718, 'elapsed_time': 0.22522664070129395}",negative
warning  spoiler alert after watching inception i have this question to ask  the movie played with the idea  that we can t always tell the difference between a dream and reality  sometimes when dreaming  we realize  that we dream and that helps us awake  other times  we don t realize that we are dreaming and then we are stuck in the dream  the question  which everybody ask themselves is  did cobb awake at the end of the movie or did he kept dreaming  i would like to ask this  does it matter  because through the two hours  i didn t get any background of this guy  i don t know who he is  what he likes to do  where are his faults  what are his hopes for the future  i am not even sure if he has a wife  and if he does  if mal exists  then i don t know anything about her too  not to mention their supposedly small children  my point is  this movie didn t have any story  didn t have any heart  didn t have any life in it  all characters were just figures  with no background and no emotional structure  so what do i care about cobb  or his wife  or his mission  because i don t even know what his mission was  to make the asian guy even richer  and if you think it is so wonderful  that the movie didn t gets any straight answers  let me tell you this  the movie doesn t even ask a question  it doesn t make you think  because  at the end of it  there is no story behind it  there is no moral dilemma  there is no character development  and i feel really sorry for leonardo dicaprio   who started as a very promising actor  but somewhere in the way decided to act important and pretend to be smart  first he made the blood diamond  a very good movie  then he made 11th hour  a very good environmental movie  and then he went vacationing with naomi campbell on an yacht  what better way to prove that you believe in what you preach  don t make the mistake to believe inception has anything to offer  but some false sense of self importance,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.07726649194955826, 'elapsed_time': 0.2112898826599121}",negative
unless you re willing to commit and remain fully engaged  it s best to put off watching this film until those conditions are met  that s because the picture moves across various levels and back again over the course of the story  and though it may seem confusing  you ll be ok if you keep in mind the premises offered by the inception team   dicaprio  levitt  hardy  page and rao  i m purposely leaving off watanabe because he was by his own admission a  tourist  and had a stake in the outcome in a movie universe that s virtually impossible to crack with something original  this is the most creative picture i ve seen in a long time  like an intriguing time travel story  this one grabs hold of the imagination and allows one to consider the possibilities of an alternate reality  the closer technology brings us to these cutting edge barriers of time  space and mind  the more fantastic becomes the possibility of turning virtual reality into the real thing the movie s strongest feature is it s exposition  the characters both show and tell the viewer what to expect  quite unusual when it comes to the  tell  part  because we usually rely on the development of the characters and the events they experience to bring us along for the ride  the concepts here are much more esoteric  especially when attempting to layer the events of the story in a  dream within a dream  construct  for the most part  i think this was all done quite cleverly  but again  you have to pay attention it would be tough to come up with the most interesting concept touched on by director nolan  but the one that intrigued me the most was the idea of the dreamer having the ability to block an extraction  in fischer s  cillian murphy  case  his training foresaw the need to  militarize  his subconscious against attack  thereby creating  projections  that in turn attacked the inception team  another clever idea involved the zero gravity effects of participants in the level two dream during the fischer inception  this is all done with such frenetic skill that it s sometimes tough to keep up with  although repeat viewings clear up what may have been missed the first time around  another hint   use the captions on your dvd to capture all the dialog  the players tell you a lot of what you need to know to follow the story i don t want to go too far out on a limb and tell you this is the greatest thing since sliced bread  because i know the film won t appeal to everyone  however enthusiasts of good science fiction will find a lot to like here  as it invites the viewer to expand one s consciousness and dream of the possibilities  seriously folks  no one had to plant the idea  it just came out like that,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9897925853729248, 'elapsed_time': 0.20951628684997559}",positive
dreams feel real while we are in them  its only when we wake up that we realize something was strange    i think i am in love with this movie  this is a very captivating movie which is slickly edited and directed  i don t want to hype this movie too much  but this movie is truly the best film in this year by far  and one of the best of this decade  christopher nolan is one of my favourite directors and leonardo di caprio is also one of my favourite actors  i cannot believe that this incredible actor gets snubbed at the oscars year after year even after doing so many amazing movies  anyway  the idea for the creation of this movie is not exactly new  i have seen some movies which take place inside the subconscious mind  but inception pushes the boundary to a whole new level  there are three levels  a dream  within a dream  within a dream which is a whole new concept and it was exciting  for every 5 minutes in the real world  it is an hour in the first level dream state  a week in the second level and some decades in the third level  the film scores some brownie points for the concept itself  my friends and me were captivated by the world of dreams  the great background score along with the taut screenplay was spectacular cobb  leonardo di caprio  is the best at what he does and the us government is wary of his skills for which it has made him an international fugitive  cobb isn t your normal skilled thief  he is the best in the dangerous art of extraction  that is he delves deep into your subconscious mind while you are asleep and steals valuable secrets  this rare superior ability of cobb has made him a coveted player in the immoral world of corporate espionage  during one of his normal extraction jobs  he cannot uncover the secret that a corporate leader  saito  ken watanabe  is hiding  saito offers him his life back in usa with his children if he does one last job for him  inception  planting an idea in the human mind is a far more dangerous job than extraction  but cobb accepts and assembles a group of talented players to pull off this mission  ariadne  ellen page  is the new comer and her job is to design the world in the dream  as the previous guy isn t exactly available and cobb himself has took himself out from designing  mal cobb  marion cotillard  keeps ruining cobb s perfect dream plans and there seems to be a dark secret which nobody know  cobb could potentially destroy their lives if he cannot control his memories and dreams when christoher nolan announced that he would put batman on the backburner and make this movie with di caprio  i was really disappointed because although i am a fan of di caprio  i loved the new batman franchise under the direction of nolan  it was darker  more intense and definitely more exciting  and i wanted the third part to be made soon  if you have seen the trailers for inception  you know that it doesn t explain much about the plot  but it looked stunning and i went along for nolan s ride  being a willing participant  i was blown away and most of you will be too if you would be willing to accept the plot  to write a dream is difficult in this era when most of the stories out there are just rehashed versions of the same story  somebody should try to follow in nolan s great footsteps  because we need more filmmakers like him who aren t afraid to blast away the boundaries and create their own benchmark  this movie will be remembered and hailed for generations to come some movies make you think deeper even after you finish watching it and this is definitely one of them  tom keeps on dreaming that one day he will be able to return to his home and live with his children in reality  but the boundary between dream and reality is blurring  marion cotillard s scenes were gripping and my heartbeat was racing when she was on the window sill  the english guy gave the lighthearted moments in the movie which i liked  the movie takes us through a roller coaster ride  oscillating between dream and reality and sometimes i was left wondering whether the events were taking place in someone s dream or in reality  christopher nolan has displayed some excellent film making techniques and come up with a story that is intelligent as well as exciting  the performances are great across the board and i am truly hoping that leo di caprio gets an oscar nod this time around  two back to back amazing movies from him   shutter island and inception  oscar is way overdue for him   the supporting cast of ellen page  joseph gordon levitt  tom hardy  ken watanabe  marion cotillard  dileep rao  michael caine were great  di caprio headed the group on his able shoulders and doesn t disappoint  three cheers to the master director  christopher nolan 10 10,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9982026219367981, 'elapsed_time': 0.20718693733215332}",positive

this film is downright boring  i literally almost fell asleep at a noon showing  i also almost walked out 35 minutes before it ended  i simply did not care about any of these characters  the effects are neat  and look pretty great  but the story is so asinine that    wait  no  the story isn t asinine  its execution is at its heart  this is the story of a man who regrets something that he said to his wife and through the miracle of modern technology  he believes he s able to unring a bell  that s it  really  yet  rather than tell that story  a bunch of other nonsense is heaped in for     i dunno why  to be honest with you in addition  the film sets up its own rules and seems to break them at will   we can t do that or this will happen   seems to be the recurring predicament and yet  when at the crossroads  they just do  this  anyway and don t suffer the consequence  or they create some back door which  according to the logic presented earlier in the film  was impossible as an example  there s a scene where the page character  the architect  is given her first  go hence  and she creates a compelling world that she managed to manipulate with ease  in fact  the leo character comments  twice   on how amazing she is at it  and yet  when they re  enter  or create another  dreamworld  they are all of a sudden ambushed on all sides  their truck is pursued and shot up  etc etc  however  they ve already shown that the dreamworld does not have to obey the regular laws of physics  or anything really    why not just have things fall from the sky and crush the bad guys  when  trapped  on the middle of the bridge  someplace they need and want to be   why not just create physical barriers between themselves and the bad guys so the bullets can t hit them but they can still drive off perhaps the director s answer to that question is that these are trained military attackers  uh huh  which is why 8 million of them are unable to shoot up one van driven by a chemist  the same problem occurs earlier in the film  in the real world  when a bunch of agents are chasing leo  why give them guns  if it s a foot chase  i ll buy what i was shown  by arming the pursuers  all i do is roll my eyes every 3 seconds at how preposterous the escape is  it s the equivalent of showing a bomb with 3 minutes left where the screen time is still a half hour  guess what  hollywood  your choices had the opposite effect you intended  our anxiety isn t heightened  but our disbelief is further  when you re watching the action  you re aware that it takes place one  two and three levels deep  the further out you are from the farthest depth  the slower your action takes place  this is seen correctly when the van goes off the bridge    but if it were in fact the case  the van could not drive at regular speed prior to that    it would be slow all the time  that would be boring  you say   i say it was boring anyway  nolan proves once again that he s the worst action sequence director going   but boring isn t the issue  time and distance are  if it were slower  as it should be  they couldn t traverse the distance needed to the bridge     which brings up the question that if you re the one creating the world  why not make your two destinations side by each  the hotel and the bridge do not need to be at opposite ends of the city  considering the bad guys are not going from the bridge to the hotel  there is constant reference prior to the world being created that it s a maze  no  actually  it isn t  there s nothing maze like about it in another scene  two of the main protagonists  who we ve been shown are expert in the work they do  declare the mission a failure and complete  but the page character  who joined the team a mere few days ago  stands up and explains to the experts how it s not over and can still go on  i groaned out loud at that one  not only because it s a ridiculous thing to expect your audience to swallow  but because it meant there was another 30 minutes left anyway  i m rambling on  the acting was fine  the ideas in the story are interesting  but the film as a whole was very insignificant  there is so much needless exposition  it s laughable   and there s a lack of exposition where needed   in short  the film lacks grace it really is unfortunate that nolan s career  from an artistic level  is tanking so poorly  worse is that his box office is not reflecting this  which will only encourage this behavior  the man s first 3 features were fantastic but since then he s just been getting worse and worse  though i don t think this film is half as bad as dark knight  it isn t a tenth as creative or well done as the following  insomnia  or memento  which it doesn t appear he will ever top,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.004837017972022295, 'elapsed_time': 0.24509954452514648}",negative

inception is an interesting movie without a doubt  refer to one of the countless other reviews for why that is   what i am going to focus on is why i think it s not a 9 10 which is what the imdb voters on average have given it  i will also make the presumption you have seen the movie  as it s not productive to repeat the plot  the second reason is because a fair amount of time has gone since i saw the movie  twice   and although that means i ve had lots of time to think it through  i don t remember all the details first  let me state the most immediate reason to why i didn t like the movie that much  the second half of the movie is a long string of bog standard action sequences  yes  it s trying to be tense  but it doesn t manage to surprise me one bit   the ending is nearly completely predictable  throughout  i care about only a few of the characters  and about none of the endless imaginary minions they are facing  if this fairly large flaw had been absent  the movie would at least have been a 9 10 for me now for the more subtle problems  i feel that not enough was done to emphasize that the mission takes place in a dream world  most of the time  the movie s  dream  world is indistinguishable to the real world  this similarity is intended  it is argued that the dreamer otherwise would become suspicious and wake up  or reject inception   unfortunately  it means there are few chances to surprise us    that s where we return to  bog standard action sequences   sure there are a few cool twists that illustrate the characters are in a dream  like the city being turned upside down  but these devices are for the most part absent once the inception mission starts  and thus have minor impact in total obviously  this movie defies all physical laws  which would be okay if there is an alternative set of rules to cover for reality  it doesn t have such a coherent rule set however  instead  it is mostly reminiscent of movies where anything convenient is made up for whatever is supposed to be happening on screen  the bad guys perform wildly differently depending on whether the protagonists are supposed to be able to escape or not  rules for various dream levels diverge too much  and so on  in short  the script fails to lend itself credibility   one cannot simply say  it s a dream  we don t have to care about plausibility  aside from more than a few inconsistencies and  too implausible to be believable  facts  is is noticeable the background story universe is mostly invented from scratch for this film  perhaps it would have benefited inception if a clearer connection to some existing religious or other fantasy theme had been made  we can only speculate for now  but i do hope someone decides to make another movie with the  entering dreams of others  theme with stronger ties to some existing mythology all in all  these complaints are pretty minor  except for the aforementioned way inception attempts too much to be an action thriller movie towards the latter parts   i m giving it 7 10  since it made me stare at my watch several times to determine when i would no longer have to endure more clinical action sequences without substance,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.03534302860498428, 'elapsed_time': 0.20285415649414062}",negative
inception  is a decent science fiction  thriller which balance very well the action  the drama  and the suspense the direction is good  with a decent visual presentation  strong performances  good character development and a story which is entertaining enough to keep my interest during the whole thing  despite the fact that i consider that would have been much better present the dream world from a more  imaginative  or surreal perspective rather than the realistic approach done by nolan in this movie  i guess that was point  portraying dreams that were hard to distinguish from reality  and in that aspect  this doesn t disappoint  i guess that this movie would be more appreciated for the public if it wasn t for the massive amounts of hype that it received after it was released  personally i don t think that it s the outstanding masterpiece than some critics and the supporters have proclaimed  but it is a good film anyway  which qualifies as a decent entertainment  inception  is worth watching  but don t expect it to be a life changing experience,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9938452243804932, 'elapsed_time': 0.25445985794067383}",positive
people who are reviewing this as the best movie they have ever seen seriously needs to wake up from their dreams  i don t know who planted this idea in their brain that this is directorial tour de force by nolan but one thing is for sure  ledger saved nolan s glutes bigtime  his screen writing technique is feeble  creativity doesn t merely consist of just going berserk with visual treat and showing whatever comes in a ten second unchecked  brainstorming session rather creativity requires constraint  and this movie lacked any constraint whatsoever if it wasn t for the ultracool visual effects and graphics this movie would be nothing but a vacuous thought bubbles of a person  whereas nolan s dark knight  instilled by ledger s genius  was entirely character driven  this movie was entirely fueled by graphical eye candies  a movie resonates over time when you want to watch certain scenes from it over and over and over again in youtube or your blu ray disc rented from your local chinese 99c video store  there were no witty dialogs or any memorable scene in the film that will compel me to stay transfixed in the screen and rewind it over and over and over again movies like vanilla sky had the same concept yet was made more artfully where the director didn t go overboard with visual scenes while having barely substantial plot people need to seriously have a reality check  but if majority of the viewers are giving positive reviews  and if you are the only one going against the crowd that surely means there is something  wrong  in your system  tsk  tsk  tsk what naysayers won t realize is that it would be more comforting to delude oneself and jump on the bandwagon saying it was great film  than admit that they got  jipped   10 00 for some sony vegas type of wizardry  hey it s the summer after all and it s not  cool  to say things which may otherwise offend your friends,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9871349930763245, 'elapsed_time': 0.20406436920166016}",positive
inception has the capacity to blow you away just like the classics of decades gone by namely the godfather movies and movies by the likes of scorcese and scott  this movie is the classic of our generation and nolan truly deserves his place among the elite the movie has a scintillating pace throughout and the premise despite being far fetched has a believable quality to it thanks to some amazing performances and intelligent direction the viewer is immediately thrown into nolan s world of corporate espionage and extraction of  ideas  the editing is magnificent as the audience is often subjected to following multiple narratives without losing connection with the plot there is a lot of craft involved in revealing just about enough at just the right time to keep you on the edge once the movie pushes into the triple dream layer sequence one cannot help but gape in astonishment at how mind boggling special effects are seamlessly combined with the intricacies of the plot the climax quite simply  takes your breath away just like the climaxes of earlier nolan films like  following  and  the dark knight  the performances are commendable and one wonders how nolan always seems to get his casting perfectly apt leonardo dicaprio has evolved so much from the days of  titanic  his role though similar to the one he played in  shutter island   evokes sympathy for the man whose inner guilt poses the greatest hazard to the mission its a balanced performance and his scenes with marion cotillard are terrific joseph gordon levitt is a pleasant surprise turning in a very neat job with his portrayal of arthur ken watanabe is quite classy and exudes panache throughout tom hardy and ellen page play their parts well but the one to look out for is cillian murphy in his role of an heir to a billionaire oil tycoon he excels in bringing out the torment and angst associated with living in the shadow of his father michael caine though  is a bit underused and one always yearns to see more of him hanz zimmer has once again emerged with a winning score which completely takes over the movie in the final few minutes and pushes the climax a few notches higher the undertone is a tad similar to the one used in  shutter island  but one enjoys the ominous music as it lends a certain gravity to the overall mood all in all  if you watch it once you will watch it again and then again and again because each viewing offers something new something extra when i saw  the dark knight   i said to myself that nolan has truly reached his pinnacle and that this here is his masterpiece its a pity that i did not check my totem then i must have been dreaming,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9946529269218445, 'elapsed_time': 0.2411353588104248}",positive

after reading a few of the reviews on this site  we decided to watch  inception   and we went with great expectations  unfortunately  the movie was a big disappointment the impression  inception  leaves is that the director tried to squeeze as much action as possible into one movie  and it seems that it was therefore that the story was split into reality and four additional  unreal  dreamworlds which are displayed almost simultaneously  there is hardcore action with aggressive special effects  fighting  killing  excessive shooting  explosions  car chases  snowmobile chases and the liking in every layer  and the permanent hopping from one layer to another makes this a non stop action flick while the story behind all this seems to take a back seat if one likes action and special effects  the movie might be interesting   the storytelling is poor  the plot and the technology involved are so complicated that  after a while  one gets indifferent  there is almost no identification with the main characters  in this movie  almost anything can happen  and the audience will accept it because it can t follow the story  like this  no suspension can be built  and over two hours full of action without suspense and bad storytelling can be rather tiring the story itself is not very clever  the setup reminds of the  matrix    the old question of what is really real  however  the idea of an powerful asian industrial boss who hires a crew to secretly invade his competitor s brain in order to increase his own profit  and who deliberately risks his own life during the operation  is very far fetched  he could just as well shoot all of his competitors  because according to the story  the asian boss is so powerful that he does not have to fear any governmental action  so  why invading brains  risking the own life and the life of others instead of just getting rid of the trouble by shooting it  then  there is a weird aspect about the dreaming itself  i can imagine that everything happens inside my own dream  but to have many people dream the same dream simultaneously because they are plugged to a special device    i don t know  i am not someone who screams for logic in movies  but this was hard to take this movie is just an action movie disguised as clever science fiction which it is absolutely not  there are great special effects  but there are too many of them and after a while they seem to become an end in themselves  the story is badly told  and the movie leaves you with nothing to think about,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.023871414363384247, 'elapsed_time': 0.23590421676635742}",negative

definitely not a 9 out of 10  or a top 250 movie  i have an idea  let s fabricate a semi comprehensible plot which is grounded so feebly in reality that it s meaning can be subject to anyone s interpretation  therefore critics will refuse to pan it out of fear of being perceived as idiots  the public will refuse to criticize it out of fear of being perceived as shallow  and everyone else will wonder what they ve missed  oh  and to top the cupcake with a cherry  we ll deliver an ending which offers no resolution  it can t fail  the concept of reality vs  fantasy was definitely better delivered in the matrix   and this movie is not its equal or even a strong competitor  the concept of dream invaders was dealt with much more enjoyably in dreamscape  1984   and was much easier to comprehend  this movie was more of an enigma burrito wrapped in a layer of fantasy tortilla  topped with sour cream special effects  and hyped by popular salsa  get it  only the most hippest and most intelligent can understand my allegorical comparison,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9689354300498962, 'elapsed_time': 0.21749591827392578}",positive

i won t waste too much of your time with this one  and i wish chris nolan had done me the same courtesy  please excuse the generalization  but a successful movie typically uses its characters as the engine to pull you into the action and involve you in their lives    their story  as i watched things fall and explode and everyone floated around in their weightless dream dimension  i simply couldn t find a single reason to wonder how things turned out for anyone in the end  does cobb make it out on time  does he stay with mal in the dream dimension or return to reality  does he ever see phillipa and james again  i tried  but i just could not find a reason to care  it should get a single star for the for the terrible story  but i tossed in an extra star for the epic scale and for dicaprio s acting  which was  as usual  proficient and workmanlike  one small confession  i did actually fall asleep for about twenty minutes somewhere in the middle of the second hour  so it s possible that the twenty minutes i slept through was actually the good part  save yourself the nightmare of having paid to watch this and wait for it to show up on free cable,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.0021056572441011667, 'elapsed_time': 0.2299036979675293}",negative
inception is an intellectually stimulating and engaging sci fi corporate espionage action movie  a great introspective drama about guilt  loss  and reconciliation  what s the most resilient parasite  it s an idea  resilient  highly contagious  once an idea has taken hold in the brain  it s almost impossible to eradicate  quotes the script  inception directed by christopher nolan is a heist film in reverse  instead of taking something  one must extract and plant ideas in the subconscious through dreams  a great original concept movie  the movie seemed to invite the audience into its multi layered dream and keep us there until the very end  without spoiling too much  the movie felt like a dream  watching it  like a dream  it s confusing and each one of us will draw individual conclusions and interpretations in order to try to make sense of it  the ending alone is up to debate  and there is no real  wrong answer there  we see the movie through the eyes of a team assembled by extractor dominick cobb  leonardo dicaprio  and his employer  saito  ken watanabe   their job is to perform an inception on robert fischer  cillian murphy   many people believe that the main theme of the movie is the art of filmmaking  and create a new idea into somebody else s mind  it was no surprise that main character leonardo dicaprio does look a bit like christopher nolen  ariadne  ellen page  is the architect screenwriter because she design the dreams  arthur  joseph gordon levitt  is the producer point man  the guy who knows how it all works  hints why he speaks almost exclusively in expository dialogue  then there is actor forger eames  tom hardy  who can physically impersonate anyone  then  last is yusuf  dileep rao  is the special effects chemist  who allows the dreams to happen  without too much  nitpicking  the plot is the weakest  in the film  it s a bit too complex and make little to no sense  the main reason why cobb is doing this inception is kinda drawn out in face value  his job has turned him into an international fugitive who can t return home to his family in the united states and cobb see this as the only way to see his family  i know  he loves his children  but honestly  if only he just buy a plane ticket for them to visit him  overseas  the movie would be over  quicker  it doesn t help that he keeps an evil version of his ex wife mal  marion contillard   alive in his dreams  that tend to torture cobb s mind and sabotages his work  honestly  how is cobb the best extractor  he seem to fail a lot at it  it s seem odd for saito to hire a man that keeps failing  one thing  the movie couldn t get right is the dream mechanism  they set up  the movie spent the first half  explaining the dream mechanisms  and the second half  ignoring it  such good example are like people showing other people s totems  architect showing the dream mazes  even when they mention  not to show the layout  also  what is with the kicks in the movie   some motions are kicks  and others are not  wouldn t an airplane be a bit too bumpy for inception  why not use the timers for such an importation job like this  why doesn t water kicks work and don t work  the time within the dreams  doesn t make any sense as well  as people dream in different speeds  i think the movie would work better  if they told less about it  the movie doesn t need logic  it told too much  not enough show  another big question is the movie s message  honestly  the movie is about deceptive and manipulative methods  they are morally questionable  to say the least  the things  i love about the movie are the special and visual effects  the action is well done  the awesome soundtrack by han zimmler is great to hear   time  is my favorite song on there  i love how movie trailers now use the same bwoong sound effect ever time  this movie really did influence a lot of filmmakers  the acting was amazing  it made stars out of tom hardy and joseph gordon levitt  the symbolism are great  like how yusuf is the arabic form of  joseph   the biblical figure from genesis 37 50  who had the gift of interpreting dreams  ariadne is from greek mythology that help the hero get out of a maze  fischer and arthur might came from the fisher s king myth  great use of penrose stairs indeed  overall  like  i said  the movie will not be able to answer all the questions  so interpretations are common here  i like how it makes you think  but still  entertaining enough for you to enjoy it,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9969530701637268, 'elapsed_time': 0.22559118270874023}",positive

this movie is just disappointing and dreadfully bad  people are victims of the marketing campaign   this movie is complex  intellectual and multi layered and if you don t understand it then you are stupid   people don t like to be stupid and having seen that it s written  produced and directed by the same guy who did the dark knight they don t think anymore and go to see inception so  i will show you that mr  nolans movie is the opposition of  complex and intelligent   superficial  i have at least 6 arguments 1  the characters are just silhouettes  transparent and shallow  there is no psychological deepness  the protagonists are emotionless objects moved from place to place like chess figures  they don t have any soul  but what marked a movie is his developing of characters  sure  you try to create something deep with the relationship between dicaprio and cotillard but it s just pathetic  amateurish and stereotypic  and then the kids  back that we see so often that it gets on the viewer s nerves 2  the music by hans zimmer is a torture  it s so loud and indifferent that your head is ringing at the end 3  the dramaturgy is completely neglected  one destruction scene follows the next  one pursuit scene follows the next  and the end  what a big disaster  it s like in a video game  in an ego shooter  it s so stupid  almost propaganda for war 4  then  nolan will make this movie  intelligent and complex   do you know m  nolan that intellectual and deep does not mean emotionless and a confusing plot 5  nolans idea to enter in the dream of somebody else is not so bad but the idea is not exhausted  dreams are imagination  there are no rules  and they are bizarre and strange  have you ever seen a film by david lynch mr  nolan  that is like a dream    so what all the guys with guns are doing there  why are there always skyscrapers or a military base  that s stupid  there is no imagination  your dreams are copies of real life and they are even worse than reality  the only good thing is the sequence with the train 6  to select a well actor like michael caine for saying two lines is just embarrassing and disrespectful  mr  nolan is capable of making great movies  memento  the prestige  but this one is very  very poor your movie is not  complex  intelligent and deep  but just superficial and an insult for the reasonably carefully viewer,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.005201681051403284, 'elapsed_time': 0.2207329273223877}",negative

yes the cgi and slow mo is uber creative and cool and the concept is a nice spin on the  dream within a dream  trope  but a little more attention to the story setup would ve been nice to add some plausibility  suspension of disbelief really only stretches so far in the minds of your audience  not to mention marion cotillard and leonardo dicaprio have zero on screen chemistry with each other and we re supposed to believe they were married and he can t get over her  eh   names

there s something that feels pretentious about the character names chosen for the story  none of them seem to fit any particular person terribly well  which adds to their unrelatability  even though you know the names of cobb s children  it feels like he s fighting to get back to the  idea  of them  but you don t get any sense of why really  come to think of it   most characters in the movie feel like  ideas of people  instead of multi dimensional characters we can invest in  granted not every movie requires a backstory for every character  but i do want to at least care about some of them cobb doesn t emanate love for who his kids actually are and we get no real sense of them as people  they re one dimensional plot devices used to justify his obsession  which is incredibly disappointing  i would feel a lot more for cobb s struggle if we could actually feel for and empathize with the people that matter  or are  supposed to matter   most in cobb s life  also  who the hell is his children staying with after he flees the country  their grandmother we re meant to insinuate from the earlier phone conversation  if he was able to arrange for them to have someone to stay with  he would ve had time to see their faces again  no  are the grandparents divorced or why does michael caine s grandpa work and live in a different country than grandma but will still be able to bring home  presents  for cobb s kids  is he flying back to the states after the semester  who gives cobb the suggestion plane ticket to flee in the first place and why does he have to leave at that exact moment  you mean to tell me he couldn t have taken 5 seconds to run outside and wave goodbye to his kids to see their faces even while in a rush  yeah  no and how long has cobb been gone from the states exactly after he fled  a few months  a few years  if it s the latter and the kids still haven t aged at the end of the movie  why is everyone asking if cobb is still dreaming  they re literally wearing exactly the same outfits and have the same hairstyles as the day he left however long ago lmao i wonder if the studio execs demanded christopher nolan cut down the movie s runtime significantly which subsequently removed a lot of the necessary plot setup scenes  which would be a damn shame  nolan is a great director  but i doubt an extra 10 20 minutes to smooth out and not rush through all of the aforementioned issues would ve been that big of an issue  they did a disservice to what could ve been a truly great story  hence why i keep rewatching","{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9403879642486572, 'elapsed_time': 0.2196364402770996}",positive

christopher nolan is a director to be applauded  his films may be sometimes flawed   as in the case of this one   and often overrated  but at least he s a guy working in hollywood who strives for originality  inception might well be his most original film yet  a cerebral thriller that requires audiences to use their brains for once  rather than going over the same old ground  it s not quite the masterpiece that some say it is  but it is an engaging  well made  and exciting movie that pretty much demands repeat viewings the first two thirds of the movie had me spellbound  the set up is intense  throwing out wonderful ideas at the audience and not hanging around to see whether they re accepted  it s definitely a film where you have to pay attention to every second  although saying that i had no trouble following what was going on  as our characters enter dream state after dream state  i was drawn into this world with them  nolan is at the top of his game and even his super fast edited action sequences don t disappoint  with riveting gun battles and a fine car chase thrown in  too  star leonardo dicaprio s back story adds an emotional core to the movie that it would have otherwise been missing and i loved being caught up in the various outlandish shenanigans which is why the ending is a little bit disappointing   not a lot  but a little bit nonetheless  the whole setup with the snowbound fortress smacks of bond  and has a seen it all before quality the film sidestepped for the most part  it s as if nolan pushed himself to the edge with the concepts he introduced in his movie  and then stepped back  afraid  we needed more scenes like the bit with the train and the revolving corridor  and less conventional action  there s plenty of scope for truly mind blowing stuff in the dream worlds he so painstakingly creates   like the awesome early scene with the folding city  but then he just delivers some sub bond antics and wastes what could have been a truly superb premise i also had a slight problem with the ending  which goes on and on  with multiple scenes dragged out in a manner reminiscent of return of the king  although never quite as bad as that   still  these are minor flaws in an otherwise very well made and entertaining movie  the ensemble cast are great  dicaprio has matured nicely as a thinking man s hero  and the normally irritating ellen page is okay as the character whom the viewer follows into the antics  michael caine delivers a nice cameo  and ken watanabe reminds us all of what a fine actor he is  there are also good turns for up and coming stars like joseph gordon levitt  tom hardy  and marion cotillard  and a very nice performance from one of my favourites  cillian murphy  so  while it may not be the masterpiece that i was hoping for  inception is definitely a step in the right direction of intelligent hollywood filmmaking,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9977354407310486, 'elapsed_time': 0.22159194946289062}",positive

no  not intellectually  there s tons of thought  or at least editing  going on in this film  but there s no characterization  there s no heart  leo s one anguished cry of  jesus  noooo   isn t  heart   it s badly directed overacting   and  worst of all  there s no morality i m an ill tempered  outspoken  foul mouthed termagant  that by way of explanation for those about to call me a right winger  a teabagger  or a prude   but when i watched this thing i was dumbstruck not on an intellectual level  oh  golly gee  we re dream diving  like in  the matrix   only inside brains instead of a mainframe  wow  uh  sure   but on a moral one  see  the film has no protagonist  it has criminals  it has those who facilitate those criminals  activities  and it has a victim  that s all and  yes  i had   and have   a real  or is that  real    see  i m of the camp that thinks the whole sorry mess took place in cobb s bigger mess of a head  problem with that almost no one  i would have opted for a plain  sweeping  no one   no  almost   but i recall one review among dozens and dozens that hit on what i m about to say  seems to see anything wrong with the idea that cobb and his crew are  ostensibly   pretermitting for the time being the perpetual argument regarding whether the whole sorry scenario is or isn t a dream  performing an act of mental violation on an innocent man  why is this  the action isn t that impressive  even the infamous hotel corridor sequence    yes  nolan does  loud  and  in your face  very well  but the bond films have been doing more breathtaking and cleanly shot action work for four decades now   i actually laughed out loud when cobb and arthur  decked out in pimp fashion leather coats and stocking masks  shouted threats at kidnapped robert fischer in a dream warehouse   not  of course  to be confused with a warehouse of dreams  that might invoke imagination   what  you couldn t just have your goons strong arm a kidnappee in the  real  world  nolan  this is as creative as you can get   we can t just proffer  cobb must see his kids again at any cost   as an excuse   or can we   i would certainly hope not   is it because fischer is a caucasian businessman  and therefore intrinsically deserving of attack in this economically volatile era   the argument that fischer s business rival saito is somehow bravely trying to prevent fischer from forming a monopoly is weak at best  that s what anti monopoly laws are for  and  by agreeing to attack fischer on saito s behalf  cobb is merely enabling saito to form a monopoly of his own  and  seriously  inception and or extraction would be ridiculously iffy forms of espionage  break into the safe inside my skull  cobb my boy  and enjoy the five hundred verses of  i m  enry the eighth  i am  i ve got planted there   or is it  possibly worst of all  because cobb and his goons  kindly  leave fischer with happy thoughts of his coldhearted father   from monopolies to psychiatry  then  if robert fischer has daddy issues  that s what analysts are for  cobb and his stampeding creeps are in fischer s mind to commit a crime  any  resolution  they provide him is a byproduct of that crime  and resoundingly  cruelly false  we might argue that cobb and his crew are anti heroes  but they re not   the dirty dozen  are anti heroes  criminals and psychopaths nonetheless working for the forces of good by fighting an evil greater than themselves  that evil being the nasty nazis   dom cobb is nothing more than a thief  and  despite the ad copy  not a very good one  perpetrating an insidious act of mental rape against an innocent man  and  by extension  all those who rely on that innocent man s business for their livelihoods   why all the sympathy for this thug and his crew  what s the catch  when children are involved  or when guilt  real or imagined  is in the mix  are we just supposed to chuck morality out the window      the last sad thing  i guess  no one on the team  not even newbie ariadne   and  granted  she s likely either a figment of cobb s imagination  like the story as a whole  or a plant   questions the  right  of what they re doing  not only does this make me deeply uncomfortable  it s incredibly shallow writing  an opportunity for character development  tossed  but that s classic nolan  isn t it  if he can t cover it with an iconic grunt    she was lovely   arthur deadpans to ariadne  when ariadne asks what nasty dream shade mal was like when she was alive  heck  arthur  she s still  technically   lovely   we were looking for maybe just a touch of explanation here regarding her relationship with cobb and the team  big boy    it doesn t get covered   or  in the end  are we just supposed to excuse the immorality of the situation by saying   ha  it s all a dream anyway    very much bothered by this  especially since this behemoth has gulped down some one billion dollars in box office take worldwide        and that s why i m giving it two stars  cillian murphy looks very nice in his natty suits  and he cries very prettily before nolan realizes that   horrors    someone is emoting on screen  and jerk cuts away  marion cotillard does her best to squeeze dimensionality from yet another one d nolan woman part  as mal  she s a sad  psychotic  lovely mess  one star for each of them  as for the rest of it  what a pathetic reflection on

this review is not so much a review but rather an attempt to understand the threads of the movie  it is by no means authoritative and all encompassing the movie lays out many clues for the viewer  particularly the notion that an  idea  is the most insidious infection  once an idea has taken root only death can provide a release  furthermore  some people s realities eventually become a state of constant dreaming  thus  it is possible for someone to constantly require to dream in order to maintain their grasp on reality the next premise that we are introduced to is the notion that  ideas  can be taken from the mind  from that we are introduced to the notion of  inception   or the planting of an idea in the mind  the reason that inception is so difficult is because every idea that the mind has can be traced back to the source  so for most of us  ideas in our head can be traced to someone or something  a speech  a book  a movie      powerful ideas are self created ideas  they can change the world  the movie explores this quite nicely  the movie takes place in the dream world and in reality  at the end of the movie it seems that cobb is still in the dream world  but how can that be  he is reunited with his children  my thoughts  1  we know that cobb and his wife mal had managed to get stuck in the final phase of dreaming  pure subconscious  it was in this place that they built a life together of reconstructed memories  unfortunately over time cobb had enough and wanted out  mal did not believe that they were living in a lie 2  cobb  in order to get mal to get out  had to plant the idea in her head that she was dreaming and that this reality was not real  he manages to do so successfully 3  in the real world mal commits suicide because of the idea cobb planted  he cannot forgive himself 4  the fact that cobb feels so much guilt about what he did is the central crux of the movie  it is this guilt that does not allow him to  see  his children until he forgives himself 5  the movie also introduces us to the concept of paradox  the infinite loop that can be closed etc  this is a crucial step to understand because what cobb ultimately seeks to accomplish is a paradox 6  the movie is truly about cobb planting an idea in his own head but not tracing it back to himself  he needs to believe that he can forgive himself but not know that he initiated it 7  throughout most of the movie  all the characters are projections of his subconscious  ariadne is perhaps one of the most important projections because through her  he is being guided to his inception seemingly by someone else  she is a manifestation of his subconscious who is in essence helping him realize what he must do  in greek mythology ariadne is the mistress of the labyrinth  a subtle clue by nolan 8  the idea requiring inception  is that  he can return home  to his children  the idea is simple but in order to introduce it cobb needs to create the most complex world possible  this is done through the multiple dreams and multiple cast members who are ultimately projections  for evidence that it is a created world  keep in mind the numbers used throughout the last acts  those numbers appear on the ticket that cobb is holding  those numbers may have special significance to cobb   perhaps the hotel where his wife committed suicide  the ages of his children  etc  9  when mal attacks cobb with a knife ariadne shoots her  after which  cobb let s go of mal as a memory  memories are dangerous because they call attention to the dream  by getting rid of mal cobb rids himself of evidence that he is dreaming 10  when saito makes the phone call and allows cobb back in the u s   it is done because cobb can believe that someone else has taken away the restriction  it was crucial for that to be there even though cobb at any point could have seen his children 11  the spinning top does wobble a little bit when cobb leaves the room  this lends some credibility to the thought that it is  reality   however we do not see the top fall indicating that the whole thing may still be a dream  this seems to be a paradox  cobb believes this is reality  top wobbles   but this is a dream  top never spins out   can something be real to someone but still be a dream  another paradox is discussed next 12  the movie itself reveals itself to be a paradox because cobb s character plants an idea in his own head and then must disguise it  it means that over time cobb figured out a way out from his guilt  it was a spontaneous idea  and quite brilliant   the problem is that he can still trace the idea back to himself  that would mean the guilt would still be there  thus  the paradox is seemingly unsettled  how can one plant an idea in one s own head without realizing that you planted it there 13  with respect to the ending beginning on the beach  keep in mind  cobb s children appear but with backs to him on the same beach as his  it is the subconscious world  for proof that this is his dream  ask yourself  how did he get from mal s house to saito s   cobb just appeared  he  needs  to get saito to leave because only then can he  see his children   also the room where saito is in is built from memory  cobb admitted that he has a tendency to do this nolan has indeed incepted our minds  thank you for reading and reviewing,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9923771619796753,

inception is an interesting movie  however i did not enjoy it  i go the movies to be entertained  to be transported into the movie  to be involved and have my emotions stirred  inception did none of that  it failed because it focused on the creativity but forgot about the audience  credit must be given to the special effects  the acting and the creative content  but the praise stops there i have read a lot of the reviews here and i have to say i m very surprised  i simply don t agree with the high rating this movie has been awarded with  if you would like to watch an interesting  creative and action packed movie  this will not disappoint  for me  there were too many implausible  bordering on ridiculous  twists to enable me to enjoy it the technical aspects surrounding the connectivity between the participants was just nonsense  there was little explanation  little offered on how it worked and why  clearly someone thought the audience would just let that part slide and not be too fussed about the technicalities this is a selfish movie  its been written  produced and directed to be creative  amazing and intelligent   the problem is someone forgot about the audience  i for one was not engaged  transported nor were my emotions stirred  apart from feeling annoyed and disappointed i expected so much more from this movie,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9077858924865723, 'elapsed_time': 0.16200041770935059}",positive

cobb  leonardo dicaprio  is the best at what he does  and that s dream extraction  in a new form of commercial espionage cobb is hired to steal out memories and secrets from within the dreamworld of hapless victims  there to assist him is arthur  the brilliant and highly underrated joseph gordon levitt   unfortunately one of the jobs goes awry and after unsuccessfully trying to steal blueprints from the mind of saito  ken watanabe  they are forced to hide away from a backlash of their employers  saito offers a way out   help him plant an inception  an idea  into the mind of robert fischer  cillian murphy   the inheritor of a vast commercial empire  in return he offers a dream come true   a chance for cobb to return to the states and rejoin his children since inception is much harder  deemed impossible by some  than extraction cobb and arthur have to mold together a new team  ariadne  a very ordinary and forgettable ellen page  as an architect  builder of dreamworlds  eames  tom hardy  as a thief  master of dream disguise and yusuf  dileep rao  as the chemist  narcotics expert responsible for forcing people into a dream state i am quite amazed at the ranking of this movie making it one of the top films in movie history  just goes to show how easy people torpedo a movie right to the top of rankings  if it offers something more than a normal blockbuster michael bay roller coaster  not to say that this movie isn t brilliant on many levels and it is exceptionally well told  in this aspiration to being a perfect movie things go wrong for christopher nolan   it loses it s human soul and feels like a noirish action movie devoid of emotion first of all the world itself is too perfect  unlike the visions in ubiq by phillip k  dick  surprisingly similar storyline and i believe nolan really should have made a shout out to dick for the inspiration  the dreamworld is too pristine and controlled  it could be understood that the dreamworld is put in order by the architect  but apart from one sequence near the end when we are in cobb s dream it never really feels unreal  surreal or ueberreal  ergo it never really feels like a dream  the main culprit is nolan himself who puts too many rules into the game  whilst it is quite obvious that dreams have no rules in such a clear and collected environment the magic that rules in your subconscious dissipates  the story surmises that you can even calculate the flow of time in a dream  which is absurd given how messed up everything is in a real dream  i especially found it awkward  when cobb states that when weird stuff happens in a dream your subconscious becomes aware of this and reacts by fighting off the source of  weirdness   like white cells   in my dreams it is entirely the opposite   weird and illogical are what define dreams and only after you awake do you actually start grasping that what you dreamt was wacky and out of place i couldn t help but feel that christopher nolan set up all the rules of the game and made it very logical  even organised  just so he could have a catchy story and some cool action sequences  mainly including arthur   the problem was that the whole movie tried too hard at organising the dreamworld  but put almost no focus at all to make it actually feel like a dream  for examples of how it is done i suggest  the beyond  by lucio fulci  what s worse is that nolan fails to follow his own overly meticulous logic  we are told at one point that arthur has two minutes left in his level of the dream  within these two minutes he manages to have a fight  go downstairs  take explosives off the ceiling  go upstairs  tie 5 people together and push them about 100 metres to a lift  set explosives beneath the lift and than settle down to blow them up in two sequences  oh  and he does this in a no gravity environment which makes running impossible  i absolutely despise it when someone sets up a motion of time only to ignore it when push comes to shove acting is top notch  but the movie seemed to lack true emotion  apart from one or two scenes  inception  packed no emotional wallop whatsoever  which given the story is quite a feat in itself  leonardo dicaprio plays a grownup tough guy well  but i never really felt his emotional involvement with other characters and in truth he seemed disinterested with actually seeing his kids or his wife  i never really believed that he is the type of person  that would risk everything to be back home with his kids  the movie is also too cool for its own good and almost plays out like a  matrix  wannabee movie i must also point out the absolutely appalling characterisation of saito  in several scenes he was made up to be an old guy  but looked just ridiculous   like a flashback from bad 80s horror movies  surprising that with such a budget and good overall look of the movie something as bad as this managed to creep through all in all a very good roller coaster ride with terrific dialogue and some nice performances  i loved kan watanabe and joseph gordon levitt  who both stole dicaprio s thunder   nonetheless once you scrape of the surface not much left to behold and you can be left deeply wanting  a good summer blockbuster action movie  who tries to pretend to be more intelligent than it actually is by the way  all the best sequences  inception  has to offer were shown in the trailer,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9897489547729492, 'elapsed_time': 0.13756322860717773}",positive

christopher nolan  the director of such memorable pictures as  the dark knight  and  memento   among others  has taken visual imagery and special effects to a new high  adding a fairly intriguing plot to the mix with his newest effort   inception  and while the film tends to employ a bit too many shoot   em up scenes  gets a little convoluted and drags near the end  it is nevertheless one of the better products of 2010 it was a story that has been in nolan s dreams for at least 10 years  now  in its fruition  it s living up to most of its hype   so far basically  it s  dreamscape  meets  the matrix  meets  mission  impossible  meets  shutter island   but with enough originality to set itself apart from these movies and features a cast that includes oscar winners marion cotillard   la vie en rose   and michael caine   hannah and her sisters    the cider house rules    along with nominees leonardo dicaprio   the aviator    blood diamond    emma page   juno    tom berenger   platoon    pete postlethwaite   in the name of the father   and ken wantanabe   the last samurai   story has cobb  dicaprio  and arthur  joseph gordon levitt   500 days of summer    third rock from the sun  tv series  as extractors  or corporate dream thieves  if you will   who rip off ideas and concepts for a huge company that profits from the acts  but when the two attempt to extract secrets from industrial giant saito  wanatabe   they are met with mixed results having failed their mission  the two are now on the run from company goons  but saito offers to clear things up if they use their skills to plant an idea into the mind of a corporate rival  robert fischer  jr   cillian murphy   breakfast on pluto    redeye    evidently  planting an idea is much more complicated than stealing one  so cobb has to assemble a team to do the job add dream builder ariadne  page   driver yusuf  dileep rao   avatar   and forger eames  tom hardy   thick as thieves    oliver twist   to the mix and soon the group has sedated fischer aboard a 757 and is traveling through his subconscious  they must  however  travel through several layers of his psyche and induce a dream within a dream within a dream to properly plant the seed meanwhile  cobb is fighting his own demons based on memories of his late wife  mal  cotillard   it s a relationship where the two created their own virtual world but it all came crashing down when they lost touch with reality or did they that s the question  or problem  that left some viewers scratching their heads after seeing this film  the script is highly imaginative and compelling  but the movie does tend to overlap itself with cleverness until is almost becomes too intellectual for its own good that  and the subplot involving cobb s little children is uninteresting and unnecessary aside from that  this was well done on so many levels that the long running time and sequences at the snow fort   while annoying at times  did not detract for the overall enjoyment of the experience perhaps released a bit too early for much academy award recognition in the acting department  although dicapio and cotillard stand out   expect big things for the visual effects and maybe the cinematography  we ll see for now  just soak in one of the more innovative and imaginative works you are likely to see for a while,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.995999276638031, 'elapsed_time': 0.14423227310180664}",positive

so you can enter somebody s dream and plant an idea and then watch it develop into some big world changing decision event  well honestly i d rather have telepathy to enter somebody s thoughts where i could do a whole lot more but that s not exactly what inception is about  if i follow the story it was about planting the seed of doubt in a competitor s mind so he would sell him company or something like that  i found a lot of things in this movie pointless and how exactly can u have a dream within a dream within a dream  isn t that like saying i m eating a meal within a meal within a meal  seriously if this was all the studio could come up with i d rather watch superman stop a bullet with his invulnerable eye again and again and again,"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.443281352519989, 'elapsed_time': 0.1381690502166748}",neutral

in summary  if you consider yourself a seriously thinking individual who wants more than mindless explosions  then you will be dissatisfied with this movie  it is littered with flaws firstly the film is amoral  all of the characters are criminals  yet in this film the audience is encouraged to like them or at least ignore their shortcomings as if what they do is nothing more than unfortunate or a product of circumstances or society  then there is the cavalier way in which a young girl is lured into a life of crime  hey  but it s cool  so therefore okay  no its not  i can understand and believe that a university professor would happily introduce the girl to the criminal   basically  the professor is  aiding and abetting   and university lecturers are warping kids  minds to their own left wing ideology every day  without a shred of guilt  so i can accept this professor s involvement in this perversion of the girl  but its offensive that the movie treats this as acceptable behavior then we are supposed to believe that dicaprio s character can get the girl into one of his dreams without her knowledge   how that happened is never made clear  and then when she finds out that her mind has been violated  she doesn t really seem to mind  you d think she d be straight to the police  but supposedly the dream world is so alluring  that she doesn t mind that what they are proposing is illegal  a violation of someone else s mind  and that she s putting her trust in a criminal who had no qualms in violating her  and who is himself  psychologically and morally corrupt  would a supposedly well rounded girl really be that suicidal  a troubled  tattooed girl on the streets  struggling with a drug habit  might have been a more plausible character  but a clean cut girl attending university  hopefully society hasn t sunk to that depth yet  where a girl of that background can be corrupted so easily and her exploitation then tolerated if not celebrated by the audience now onto some of the other flaws  one of the main faults  was that the van was hit and penetrated by multiple bullets over an extended period of time and only one person was wounded  we kept seeing shots of the van with bullets slamming into it  yet no one else is hit   even though the van is riddled with bullets and no panel left untouched  most of the bullets went through the van  but in one scene a bullet hit the edge of the van door and hardly damage the paint some people seem to think that because it is a dream  anything can happen  so are there no rules  wasn t the world designed in advance by the architect  is the world supposed to be redesigned or altered in dream time  and if so why did that guy get shot  and why couldn t he be healed instantly by the dreamer  there seemed to be many contradictions  sometimes the worlds acted as if they were pre defined and unalterable    other than by the mind in whose head the dream was occurring  unconsciously fighting off the interference  but at other times the person who was dreaming seemed to be able to control everything i m also confused as to whose head was hosting each dream how can a sequence of explosions in three different dreams be timed to such perfection that each goes off one after the other in sequence  particularly without a sophisticated timing device  and when different dreams were being controlled by different people  if that was the case   dicaprio seemed to work out the timing in his head  nonsense and the ski lodge scene was also unbelievable  the character was invincible  which led credence to the idea that it was his dream  but then if that was the case  why go to all of this trouble blowing up the building  the guy whose mind they were infecting  was dead or unconscious towards the end of the scene  so couldn t the dreamer just dream that the building drops off a cliff or is hit by an alien spacecraft or something equally preposterous since they made it so involved in causing the fall  i assume that the dreamer was limited in what they could do  and that is borne out by most of the dreams in the movie being constrained by real world consequences  so i think the dreamer was constrained as to what they could do  otherwise they wouldn t need the fuss trying to get an explosion to occur the explosive charges weren t drilled into the reinforced concrete walls of the building  so the explosions wouldn t have destroyed the building  and then when the explosions occurred it is more likely that the upper story would have crashed down on their bodies  squashing them without any feeling of falling being involved there are many more flaws in this movie  the asian character that had been shot wakes up just at the right moment to lob a grenade down the tunnel  dicaprio hasn t heard of the phone or email and so must travel the world to be his criminal cronies  there is too much shaky camera  the cinematographer hasn t heard of a steady cam  the dream within a dream concept is a rip off of the vr  virtual reality  worlds within worlds  that was done much better in the movie 13th floor many years ago  there is none stop action that ends up being boring  we don t care about the characters or the main goal of the crime  dreams  or even memories  are presented in too much detail my advice if you are someone who likes it when a movie hangs together  is to switch off your mind while you watch this movie and to accept that it makes little to no sense at all,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9903658032417297, 'elapsed_time': 0.1610414981842041}",positive

christopher nolan has the penchant of playing mind games in his previous three movies  memento  2000    insomnia  2002  and the prestige  2006   inception is nolan s fourth production which brings mind games in the next higher level the story of inception is rather original  touching on areas which many have not explore before  it is further enhanced with a group of a listed cast  including leonard dicaprio  ken watanabe  marion cotillard  ellen page  cillian murphy and michael caine  with joseph gordon levitt  of  500  days of summer  and tv actor tom hardy as the leading cast  inception is a sci fi thriller which is presented without much confusion due to the various characters involved in the story dom cobb  dicaprio  is a master thief who specializes in stealing ideas from the victim s dream  when the victim is in a sub conscious state  after the plan of stealing an idea from japanese businessman saito  watanabe  fails  he was given one last chance to redeem himself  not to steal  but to implant an idea on saito s rival  robert fischer jr  murphy   with the help of his group of specialist  gordon levitt  hardy  and the recruitment of a student ariadne  page   the team began their heist on the implant of ideas  which comes with enemies they had never seen  or prepared for it inception is not your usual boring summer blockbuster flick which throws in loads of cliché plots and predictable endings  the concept may seen very similar  just like any other movie focusing on a heist  however  the catch is nolan creates the story  using the background that not many filmmakers will touch on  dreams and state of consciousness  the matrix trilogy  2000   2003  had cover on dreams and consciousness  and no other movies has touched on similar issues  now  these areas are once again  being explored and brought to a new level nolan awes the audience by creating state of sub consciousness in layers  which means a dream within a dream  ideas in real life becomes the setting and background for a person in their dream  where what has happened in real life will determine what will happen in the dream  an example created by nolan in this case  a person will be flooded in their dream when he she was woken up by water in real life  this seems magical  and at the same time  logical  thus  to enhance the thrill the audience are experiencing  nolan creates a new level of sub conscious state the team will be experiencing by what is happening to them  which in someway  looks like a chain reaction in different sub conscious levels dicaprio s role of cobb is the center of the story  where his decision will affect the people around him  together with the outcome of the heist  while he is creating the most perfect crime to salvage himself  he will need to overcome the grief of the death of his wife  mal  cotillard   which can be his potential enemy  by implanting the role of mal in the world of cobb  we can see how cobb is crippled by the thoughts of mal  while trying to create the perfect heist both issues discussed above creates the labyrinth within the movie itself  where audience are brought to a labyrinth  and they have to figure out on ways of getting themselves out  while the labyrinth is created in the movie for the team to avoid and deter the attack of unknown enemies  the audience is brought to the labyrinth  where they need to figure out what happens next  certain form of interaction between the team and the audience exists in inception though the audience might not get much action sequence in inception compared to nolan s previous acclaimed production  the dark knight  2008   an interaction has been created for the audience  which is something that is very much lacking in the movies we are watching in cinemas today if the summer blockbusters playing out there fails you  go for inception  you will have fun and you will never regret  for there is always something new for you  waiting to be explored,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9929625391960144, 'elapsed_time': 0.13890385627746582}",positive

and by deception rather than inception i am referring to the title of this movie as although the film is good  it s far from brilliant and i have to say i left the cinema feeling rather deceived by all of the great reviews out there from the public and critics alike who had heralded this flick a masterpiece  but a masterpiece it is not  in fact  it s rather derivative from other films christopher nolan has directed  including memento and the prestige  with shades of 2001 a space odyssey permeating the picture as well  now dicaprio  of course is mesmerising as always  yet he doesn t really have a lot to do as he mopes about missing his children without really expressing the distress he feels to the audience very well  sure he anchors in the film  and in a very subtle way  but to subtle for me   almost boring subtle  which really griped me as i prefer his more flamboyant and boisterous roles  roles he has played in films such as shutter island and blood diamond really allow him to work those acting chops of his and usually make for a very entertaining film  this film just didn t let him do that the film  although visually superior to most others out there on the market today  left me with a feeling of boredom at times and by the end i felt the pay off i had been desperately waiting for didn t arrive and instead of sharing the elation of the critics and audience alike i was left with a  o my god  was that it  replaying in my mind so my advice   watch this film by all means  but be warned  that although it is at times intriguing and thought provoking most of the time it s meandering  plodding and ultimately quite pointless  good but not that good  6 10  3,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9654492735862732, 'elapsed_time': 0.15509605407714844}",positive
the nolan s inception has similar inviting conceptualisms as does the wachowski s the matrix  but it just doesn t have any of the cool bullet dodging or adequate proper inspiration  which is to say the action is sub par in this masterpiece gone awry  lost in limbo to say the least and to say the most  i think that if there would of been just a little bit more of a discern to entertain as the overall main objective of the movie and perhaps maybe even to shift the primary focus of the film a tad more towards the action orientations of the dreamworld as opposed to the overkill of dwelling upon the complexities of being in control of your own dreams and the unknown aspects of the human subconscious then inception would be timeless   i d appreciate way more fighting and adventure and action here and running away from bad guys i love how the enemies appear largely as faceless people coming out of nowhere but there s not enough of it also way  way  way  way forever way less explaining how it all works and more cool action scenes leo s character   too much talky   not enough doey  it still is timeless  i love inception  it s a bit unimaginative  i m not being nitpicky here  inception is a surefire classic  obviously  i love leo    i m just pointing out here that the matrix is way cooler than this movie is  i love keanu   and will ever be but i still love it  inception s great  it possessed a seemingly undeterred route to live on in infamy  they thought up the hard part  as this movie has stretches  bursts if you will of extreme utter sheer brilliance but everybody is wearing like suits  all suits  only suits and acting all rigid like and it s sort of hard to follow honestly and stuff like what a waste of dream space  inception isn t too rewatchable over the years and the most interesting part of the story  leo s tormented love for marion cotillard who i love   lacks life and spirit and meaning and fire  ellen page is awesome in this movie she really is what a great performance from her  i love ellen  i love leo and i really love marion too  i love the rest of the cast as well  thank you  inception s an original mind bend that motivates you  awes you and leads you on straight down into the deep abyss of nothingness  a merry chase  like it goes nowhere  too much sitting  not enough kick  if you will   8 out of 10  i love all the stars  inception is brutally good only very void,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.994971752166748, 'elapsed_time': 0.14069008827209473}",positive

i ve said that about so many movies but the euphoria passes about some time after it s done  so i figured i d wait 24 hours to see if this euphoria has passed    looks like it hasn t  v for vendetta was my favorite movie  i now have to reconsider inception is an amazing movie  for one  it has one of the most interesting plots i ve ever had the good fortune to witness  look at it  stealing planting ideas through dreams  entering others  dreams  completing tasks in dreams  this stuff is what i like  the plot was very complex and multi layered  and therefore there was so much to offer in the plot  not a single moment went by where i wasn t interested the visuals are amazing  i was blown away when cobb was showing ellen page how the dream world worked  with the folding city  as well as the scenery in the arctic  the sets looked vivid and gorgeous  they complemented the film s great plot and imo  were very creepy and brooding too another reason the movie is so great is because it uses ambiguity the right way  a lot of filmmakers   ahem  michael haneke  i m looking at you      think that senseless manipulation equals a great movie  to a lot of people nowadays think it does and because of it  they rave about it like it s second coming of jesus   and this one doesn t senselessly manipulate the viewer  it challenges the viewer to piece together the puzzle and find out the answer  yet it has plenty of exciting action and suspense to offer  and it doesn t beat you over the head with the theme  you re getting your adrenaline up during the action while simultaneously piecing the puzzle together the ending  wow  i ll be thinking about this one for at least a month  it uses ambiguity the right way too  i am personally leaning towards the  he s still dreaming  side  but i definitely like the ending a lot because he could be in the real world too  my friend and i both decided last night that he s lost his mind and is in limbo  but that s what makes the ending so powerful  you interpret it your own way  see this is what i wish a lot of the pretentious directors who go for the  open to interpretation  approach did more often  end it after the resolution of the conflict and then leave the one element up to the viewer to decide  it can be interpreted many ways the movie is very long  2 hours 28 minutes  but it didn t feel long at all   i seriously thought it was only 1 hour 45 minutes  that s the thing  when you re so into a movie  when your attention is drawn to it for that long  when you re trying to piece together the puzzle  time flies so fast  i didn t even get up from my seat once and mind you i m very bad for having to go to the bathroom last night i lay wide in bed thinking about the movie  i tried to sleep but i couldn t  the movie was very powerful  it made me think about it  i was thinking about it on the way home from the imax  my friend and i were talking about it the whole way  and ruining it for people on the bus lol   it goes to show you how powerful a movie can be  it leaves you thinking  and i m still thinking about it as i type this  i am really glad i saw it as over the top as i may sound  i am not trying to sound over the top  i really loved it  way more than the dark knight  i m seeing it again on wednesday  and i cannot wait  this movie is the best movie i ve seen this year and maybe the best i ve seen in general  i do not make that up  and have seen several movies in a lifetime alone,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9919108152389526, 'elapsed_time': 0.16091465950012207}",positive
major spoiler alert  the biggest problem with inception was that i had no incentive to care about any of the characters or what happened to them  other then built in pathos  dead wife guilt issues  check  daddy issues  check  missing your family  check  there was no real drama or tension to the piece  at the end i really didn t think for more than 2 seconds about whether the totem tipped or not  because it made no difference one way or the other  i was in no way invested in leo s character another disturbing part of the film for me was the notion that even given the damage caused by leo s character s first use of inception  on his wife  he was perfectly willing to do it again  i found all of the characters morally repugnant and was rooting for them to fail  problematic as well is the attempt by the film maker to introduce stakes for actions only to immediately blot them out  at one point someone asks leo if killing the baddies is damaging the psyche of the subject  a simple  no  suffices and it is never brought up again  for what reason was it even brought up then the film also doesn t bear up to scrutiny  the world of inception didn t play by its own rules and as a result all the wind came out of the film s sails  during the van chase there was tension  if they crash they will be kicked out of the deeper layers  then the van does crash  with lots of rolling tipping  and this isn t a kick  it took all the tension out of later scenes  also when the target gets shot  which up to that point was presented as lights out leo spouts one line of expository dialogue and everything isn t kaput  we aren t very far from captain kirk suggesting a tachyon pulse the most glaring fault  however  was that despite how it was couched in terms of psychology and mental representation  the producers and director clearly had the sparknotes on freud and the publishers blurb on lacan  even an action schlock genre film like avatar had more psychological content than this  thriller   inception is a bloated mass of cgi and macguffins with nothing to say and nothing for me to care about,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.008055397309362888, 'elapsed_time': 0.1386713981628418}",negative

this is the tenth year of inception and i can fairly say this is the best film of the 21st century  i have seen it a few times and i guess less than three times won t be sufficient for any audience to understand what is happening here  as in other grandiose works of art  it inspires multiple interpretations  there is no one answer here  so it is not like finding the meaning of life or finding the truth behind the film  no  so although i inserted a spoiler alert  i don t think anyone can spoil this film and that is the beauty obviously i read about the film here and there but avoided nolan s own comments intentionally  nolan gave us the film  we watch it and each of us take something from the film  we don t need nolan s explanations separately  having said that i assume this was the masterpiece that nolan strived for as a filmmaker and if we call memento his apprenticeship masterpiece inception is his mastership masterpiece as the wachowskis waited for the right time to shoot the matrix  it looks like nolan also waited about ten years to initiate making of this film  so what do we have here  at first glance we have layers  layers of dreams  lots of action  some drama and obviously a complicated structure that could have become a fiasco with a not so talented director and shall i say without dicaprio the second or third time you watch the film you understand that there is more than that to the film  so it is not that at the first layer it is not a good film as an action packed heist movie  as one of elite  auteur  directors  who also happen to be immensely popular with the audience  like james cameron to some degree   nolan wants to talk about  other stuff  here  think about 1001 nights  where shehrazade becomes shahriyar s wife but not to be killed  she dives into a complex labyrinth of stories and drags the reader with her  in inception we also dive into the story and layers  so the inception as an idea  triggering a change in the targeted person s subconscious  is actually what as audience we are exposed to and we experience  i mean nolan challenges the movie audience here  we all become clones of fischer  we are taken into the layers of dreams one after the other and we never question if anything makes sense or not  yes there will be those movie geeks who will go after each and every goof in movies but forget about them because nolan doesn t care about them  because he understands if he can keep to a reliable plot it would be very difficult to distract the audience and why not  these are layers of dreams right  layer zero looks like reality  but who is sure of that anyways  as morpheus asks   what is real neo   so in the same way  welcome to the desert of the real here  inception talks about movies and movies are very akin to dreams  as audience we have similar feelings in a dream and a film  think about the paris café scene  where cobb tells ariadne if she remembers how they ended up in that café  this is the same impact we feel as movie aficionados  we are thrown into a film  and we can t make sure how things turned out and how we ended up in our seats fully overwhelmed  is this not what we experience in our dreams  and if one can reach catharsis  does it matter  it is in a film or dream and as such are we not all accomplished filmmakers while dreaming proudly of course  there are multiple interpretations to inception in addition to film making theory  i have read articles going into detailed analyses of philosophical and religious undertones and further subtext readings  maybe yes one can empathize with those as well  but i was more interested in the feeling of the film  that grandiose feeling that enhances its impact after seeing it multiple times the year is 2020 and i wanted to rush for writing this review before seeing tenet  let s see if nolan will be able to overwhelm us one more time,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9915141463279724, 'elapsed_time': 0.15296339988708496}",positive

i couldn t agree with kimba more  there is nothing to this film other than the special effects and crappy action sequences  the obvious story line is just as simple as the story in the matrix and was hijacked form the same philosophy books that have been around for thousands of years what they wanted you to see the special effects are very well done but reminded me of when i was thirteen and learned how to bend corners in photo shop  for the next three month any picture i created in photo shop had all the corners bent  i was so excited to show off my newly acquired skill  same thing with the special effects in this film  how many times do i need to see gordon  levitt running  fighting and falling against the walls and ceilings in the hotel room scene  how many times do i have to see the buildings crumble and the van falling in slow motion  i get it  i get it  they figured out how to do this and they are excited to show it off  great special effects  i would have been in awe regardless of what the plot line was   just for me the quality of a good movie is one which you enjoyed and would love to see again  although this movie does inspire some non independent thinking and conversation  what i am hearing about this film is that many walked out without understanding it  by their own admission  and have no intention of seeing it again  if i saw this movie being played on cable i would flip the channel so fast it would make my tv smoke  but with that said  this will be another cult movie with the same old cult following  bah bah   you do not see this because you are not aware that you are dreaming a dream within a dream here is the great part  the movie has a secondary plot line  forget the whole dream idea and whether he is or he is not in a dream and who s dream he is in and why the kids are in the precisely same position  age and outfits in the last scene as they are in dicaprio s previous recollections  apparently the character of leonardo dicaprio is based on nolan  the director  the film is about making a movie  dicaprio is the director  joseph gordon levitt is the producer  ellen page is the screenwriter  tom hardy is the actor  dileep rao is the technical guy  ken watanabe is the money man behind the movie and cillian murphy is the audience do you hear the music  the whole movie is explaining to the audience and the staff that you must create a semi believable world for the victim  the mark  the audience to be drawn in to  its about scouting a location  creating a world and getting the audience lost in it  giving the director enough time to plant a non original idea  such as   what a great movie this was  anyone feel sorry for cillian murphy   robert fisher  jr  because he was getting screwed with  well thats not murphy that was getting screwed with  its all of us is your inner ear intact after all that imax noise  because here comes your kick according to dicaprio s character or nolan  if you alter the dream world too much  like ellen page did in dicaprio s dream  the victim s audience s subconscious will turn on you  realizing its fake  a dream  and will turn on the manipulator of the dream  thus the screenwriter  director  etc  and become disengaged from the film dream and wake up   good afternoon  i am glad to see that you are awake  do you remember any of it  do you remember when the original  architect  gets killed off in the beginning  well apparently it is very common in the movie industry to replace remove the first screen writer  if you watch some of the interviews with decaprio he says that he is studying noal for his character in the film  now you know why now  wipe off the morning glory from your eyes and go outside and play,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9846324920654297, 'elapsed_time': 0.1398634910583496}",positive

first of all  let me premise this review by saying that i m not easy  hollywood seldom makes movies that i think are worth watching and 2010 has been a particularly bad year  i don t watch children s or teen s films so those aren t considered in my comments inception is in no way christopher nolan s conception which is oddly the only thing that actually supports the entire theory of it  it s a planted thought  le guin dealt with the idea in lathe of heaven back in 1971  the concept of course would never fly since humans don t trust each other  let alone strangers  or to the extant necessary as outlined by nolan  taking it to more levels changes nothing but shows that the obvious is being ignored the bad cinematography keeps the viewer from seeing scenes at the beginning of the film or was that just to save money  when a phone call ends and one party hangs up  you don t get a busy signal  picking a team you trust means using a total stranger who is willing to go along with doing something illegal  interesting definition of trust the characters were not engaging  not necessarily bad acting  you just didn t care about them  leonardo s character was boring and predictable  the others were necessary for him to talk to at and tell the rules to  only to break them for all of the eye candy  the film lacked imagination or maybe it was budget constraints or maybe nolan is just incapable of dreaming i don t need a totem  just a refund,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.3425579071044922, 'elapsed_time': 0.12804079055786133}",negative

the movie that seems to be on the tip of everybody s tongue this summer is inception  it is one of those cross over movies that receives critical acclaim  possibly making it eligible for a best movie oscar  and public adoration  possibly making it eligible to make lots of money   i have heard numerous high brow critics love it  87  on rotten tomatoes  and countless facebook comments saying how cool and weird and incomprehensible it is and i  of course  don t get it don t get mad or get me wrong  i enjoyed the film a lot and good filmmaking   nowhere near oscar worthy   but very good  it reminded me of oceans 11 or oceans 13  not oceans 12  my question for the general public is  what made it so confusing   they spend the first hour of the film explaining everything that is about to happen  you are well equipped with dream terminology like a  kick  or how dreams inside of dreams work  we already know about leo s inner demons and we understand how time operates different in dreamland in fact  i cannot remember a movie that explained itself so well  and i liked this about the movie  but based upon all the hype  i was waiting for the big twist  and it never came  i thought that maybe the whole movie was a dream of leo s character  or maybe  it was the wife who was alive and leo that was dead  again  what was so weird about the movie that it would need several viewings to understand  was it the ending  please  the end just substantiates the main philosophical question about the movie  perhaps our definition of  reality  should not be so concrete  but the ending works because the viewer will perceive the reality of the situation based on what they took out of the movie  why does the movie have to give you an answer  the director  christopher nolan  made memento and the prestige and those films  i would argue  created much more confusion  especially memento  than inception  nevertheless  i want to emphasize that i enjoyed the film and i think nolan should be proud of his effort  but it didn t leave that indelible impact upon me like a donnie darko or fight club or magnolia or syriana perhaps the answer lies within what i call the  movie review relativity scale   woody allen s worst movies are better films than james cameron s best  yet  a reviewer will score it poorly if it does not rise to his high standards  i think when a summer blockbuster is layered  as this movie is  and creates some semblance of character depth  albeit just with leo s character  we get excited crazy go nuts  i went to see an action film  but i had to sorta pay attention a bit  it was awesome   no  it was not awesome  but hopefully it can serve as a rabbit hole to explore more interesting movies like memento or dogville or countless other films in which you do have to pay attention for longer than a youtube video,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9936733841896057, 'elapsed_time': 0.22902846336364746}",positive

am i missing out on something  when i watched this movie  i nearly fell asleep half way through  once again  christopher nolan attempts a clever  slick  convoluted film and only succeeds in boring the watcher  the story is completely unbelievable and it takes about half the movie to explain the plot  sorry  not worth it  there are a few good ideas and clever camera work  but the script just drags and drags  granted  joseph gordon levitt is good  ellen page is good  leonardo dicaprio is average and cillian murphy is solid  but none of them are really able to enliven a slow moving script  by the time it got to the end  i didn t really care whether the damn thing fell or didn t  sadly  this movie allowed me to dream far too much as dicaprio tried to permeate my sleep  very disappointing  definitely not living up to the hype,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.007292863912880421, 'elapsed_time': 0.1973438262939453}",negative
sorry about my english  is not really good i ve seen this movie yesterday  and after it i asked to myself  what the hell was that  first of all  i think the way that nolan complicated the history is completely unnecessarily  nolan gives you 100 dater per second  only to confuse you  so  you think  oh  it s complicated  it s a smart movie  it s great  i m a smart guy  well  maybe you are not  the story could be easier and didn t lose the meaning  which is very stupid   nolan make it difficult only for make it difficult second  what s the point of make 30 seconds  scenes  make you feel sick and queasy  can t nolan make longer scenes  they talk ten seconds and nolan shows you visual effects ten seconds  and then they talk about dreams another ten seconds  and then nolan show you how a piece of cheesecake can become in a lemon pie  and over and over  and that s all  the history is silly  the plot is poor  the few jokes are bad  the characters are not interesting  the dialogs are really  really awful third  3º best movie ever  what are you thinking about  come on  must be a joke  why is so cool  the idea is not original  seems to be a mix among freddy krugger  matrix and an article about freud take from wikipedia   the visual effects are fine but have not sense at all  there are easier ways to say  everything is on our mind    i can t find what is so greatfourth  i think  maybe i m wrong  many people like this movie cause it make them feel smart  and they believe that they ve seen an intellectual movie  well  i m not an expert in philosophy or psychology  in fact  i know very little   and i know that the movie is fiction  but anyway  some concepts are completely wrong  i m in the school yet  third world school   and we had psychology classes last year  and the teacher taught us that the subconscious is result of repressed impulses  so  you want your mother  in a sexual way  and the culture say you  that s wrong and disgusting  so you can t support it  and that s why you have dreams  because it s so hard to tolerate so you eliminate it from your conscience  but that is still in your mind  in your subconscious  so  what dicaprio says about subconscious  is result of our emotions  is wrong  he says the subconscious is something subjective  our ideas  our emotions   and is not  what make our subconscious is the culture what cause a guilty filling and this year we ve got philosophy and we ve seen something about idealism  and skepticism  it s not true that everything is idea  there is a reality  and our mind is made of this reality  this reality  the society  makes our conscience  and the culture  which is real  make our subconscious  so  everything we think has a reality inception  we are made of reality  would be great if in the middle of the movie nicky santoro  casino  appeared and says to dicaprio   maybe if i stick your head through that window over there you won t think that everything is an idea  that s it  we need more scorsese and less nolan fifth  does anybody find an interesting story  because  i ve seen a lot of guys saying thing about dreams and everything is an idea  yes nolan  we get it  you don t have to repeat over and over   but the stories are pretty poor  di caprio s story and why the police is looking him  and his ex wife  and his children didn t trap me at all  what s more  the story about the rich guy and his father is  for me  completely ridiculous  nolan is very smart  he could think something smarter than that so  what do we have  visual effects and ideas that were taken for guys who died 300 years ago  like descartes  or even before  like the skepticism greeks   there is nothing new  or brilliant in  nolan s idea   what we have is a lot of visual effects without meaning  and nothing else is this one of the best movies ever,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.04285122826695442, 'elapsed_time': 0.20589160919189453}",negative
this film thinks it s important  however  the movie says nothing about anything  all the dream stuff is made up by the writer  nothing is based on real science  there is no explanation of anything other than just to state that things are  for example  there is no explanation on how this whole inception devise was created or how it works  other examples are the proclamation in the movie that when you die in a dream  you wake up  oh really  then there is the idea that if you die within a dream that s within a dream you go into  limbo   whaaaaaaaaat  everything that s required to put forth the story happens too conveniently  people and events happen at the right time just when they are supposed to happen this is what happens when a movie is written  produced  and directed by the same person  the producer writer director doesn t have to worry about anyone telling him their are problems with the script  no checks and balances  the movie becomes very self indulgent the music was often so loud that the dialogue was muffled and the convoluted storyline was hard to follow,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.06045931577682495, 'elapsed_time': 0.21541547775268555}",negative

ok  this is weird i am a big fan of sci fi movies  of christopher nolan  memento  the prestige  batman begins   and of dicaprio in his recent roles  i should have loved it  but i ve now watched inception 3 times  twice expecting to like it more than i did the first time  but the magic didn t really happen so what went wrong   i have in mind an official review which said  every ten years  a new movie redefines science fiction   we ve had star wars  blade runner  matrix and now  inception   this is not word for word   what    seriously   how does  inception  redefine anything   where s star wars  scope  blade runner s dark poetry  and the matrix series  mind blowing sfx and  somewhat blurry  i know  mystique   there is none of that here  sure  the movie tries to inject some interesting ideas such as limbo  where you can live a whole life in a dream state  but it never uses fully  very  very far from it  the implications of those unique concepts what we get is an almost purely action oriented movie where people only stop shooting and shouting to explain  quite well however  given the difficulty of the task  the extremely complicated structure of the multi layered dream they go through  it is so convoluted that it really takes a lot of skill to keep the viewer in the loop  and they managed to do it  thankfully  but all those constant technical explanations make the whole experience more like attending a math class than watching a movie  the whole movie is based on numbers  specifically  the importance of how long you can stay in each dream layer  down to the second  so  without the subplot involving dicaprio s late wife  which at least brings some emotion  inception would have no soul at all  none  it would just be a collection of action scenes and constant reminders of how much time there s left in such and such dream layer  what   did you say  cillian murphy s complex relationship with his father    please  the inception he s a victim of  is as much of a scam for him as it is for the viewer  far too basic  nothing interesting here the acting   quite good  what can i say  although almost nobody but di caprio had anything interesting to say  they did their best  but i know i will always resent that movie for using the extremely talented ellen page in a totally insignificant role   if you ve seen her in  hard candy  and  juno   you know what i m talking about  what is she doing here   if the role had been given to someone who had no experience of acting  it would have made no difference  in inception  page is nonexistent  not her fault though  blame her useless role and bland lines  by the way  poor michael caine too the settings    ugh  now  they really worked hard to find the worst places they could think of to shoot this movie  going down the dream ladder   a rainy city   a claustrophobic hotel   a frozen wasteland with a kind of russian base guarded by a ton of baddies in snow gear   finally  another wasteland  limbo  with ugly concrete towers  which are  whether crumbling or intact  supposed to be the paragon of what dicaprio and his wife where able to dream in 50 years   and he s supposed to be one of the best  dream architect  ever  when his supreme achievement is this   no eye candy anywhere  never  sure  it shouldn t have to be systematic  but    never   and for no reason   at some point  a character complains    couldn t somebody have dreamed of a goddamn beach    i m with you mate  basically  the movie is ugly when there is absolutely no reason for it to be  contrary to other movies where ugliness is justified  its horrible settings serve no purpose  especially what i called the awful  frozen russian base   straight out of some cheap  alias  episode  the special effects   again  nothing spectacular  except the early scene in paris where page bends the world  yeah    keyword  early   it makes you think you ll get other moments like that  hell  that unique moment is even on every  inception  poster      well  there is strictly no voluntary alteration of the laws of physics any more after that  only uncontrolled ones  and very rare at that  and none in the second half  another example of how to let a good idea go to waste  what s the point of stating early in the movie that you can do anything in the dreamworld  and then proceed to do    absolutely nothing   oh  that s right   the characters are afraid of the  projections   who get mad when someone is messing with the structure of the dream  cool  that explains it  let s not do anything then  that has to be my biggest grief so why 6 10 and not 3 or 2   because the actors are good  although with insignificant roles to play except for dicaprio s  but again  not their fault    the inception concept is good   the movie still works well as an action flick but it breaks no new ground on any level whatsoever  you want to watch a good  albeit deliberately goofy  movie which really makes you think about the terrifying danger of losing touch with reality  with the same  dream within a dream within a dream  idea  by the way    watch cronenberg s  existenz   or  strange days   these are not wall to wall action movies trying to look smart  they take their time to build an atmosphere  and they actually are smart  want more action and sfx than in those two  though with less intelligence     matrix  or  avatar    inception  has little better to offer on any level  it s just average,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.017569342628121376, 'elapsed_time': 0.1993393898010254}",negative
first off  this is indeed a really good movie  probably the best i have seen this year  i can t wait to buy it on bluray and watch it over and over  however  let s not kid ourselves  it falls very short of masterpiece all time classic status when you think of this genre of movie  you can t help but think of the matrix  that was a masterpiece in my opinion  and you can t help but draw comparison between these two films for many reasons  including the character of arthur being made up to look like neo and even having his wooden characteristics  not to mention that arthur is in a scene obviously borrowed  cough  cough  stolen  from the matrix s subway fight scene  what i love about the matrix is how its universe is well explained and there s a solid logic behind everything  notice i didn t say  perfect   you can go back and watch the movie and it all ties in together nicely  on the other hand   inception  explains the rules of its universe to the audience  quite a lot in the beginning  and i kept finding myself rolling my eyes and thinking   that s convenient   worst example is the  projections   without these characters conveniently chasing people around  a lot of the story goes down the toilet  but the logic behind their actions is simply non existent  another one is this whole thing about the  kick   sure  gravity can wake you up from a dream  if you fall while asleep  your body will feel it and you will wake up  but please  to suggest that this concept would just magically work in a dream within a dream  within a dream is just ridiculous  there s the illusion of gravity in dreams  but no actual gravity  so wtf then there are a lot of things not even explained  how does cobb s dad spot someone who would be able to build multi level sets in a dream really well  why does the chemist come along in the dream  you would think a strong action type guy would greatly advance the mission more so than a geek who doesn t add anything inside the dream  why did fischer go as far as to get training for fighting people who could invade his dreams  which means he fears his enemies  yet he has no problems getting on a ten hour plane ride by himself     i was also bothered by two other things that do not belong in a movie that wants to be labeled as a  classic   1  ken watanabe is a good actor  but for the love of all things holy  can someone get this guy better english tutors  his english is worst than jackie chan s    you can tell he s saying something extremely crucial to the plot  but you can t understand any of it  2  i know that a lot of action movies  yes  including the matrix  take liberties with scenes featuring a shoot out  you always see the bad guys shooting away at the good guys at infinitum  yet not a single scratch on the good guys  we have now almost come to expect that in action movies  sadly  however  inception abuses this concept beyond any reason  bad guys empty machine guns within two feet of the good guy s vehicles  you see the bullet holes everywhere  yet  not a single scratch on anyone  except for one bullet  i don t mind suspension of disbelief for a good movie  which this is   but it got so bad that i was beginning to take it personal that a movie would try to insult my intelligence that much you will have a good time watching this movie  but like they said in south park  just because there are a lot of twists  doesn t mean it s intelligent  and it s definitely not a masterpiece,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.05307001248002052, 'elapsed_time': 0.21080350875854492}",negative

by the time inception arrived in theaters  christopher nolan had pretty much become a household name  having directed some very popular films  including resurrecting the superhero genre with the success of batman begins and the dark knight  now  i went to see inception with a friend and had a lot fun watching it  but then again  i also had fun playing mass effect 3 the first time before realizing just how much that game sucked compared to the previous two games in the series  the same thing happened with inception  i had fun and was impressed with certain aspects of the film whilst watching it  but upon further inspection  i felt a growing sense of disappointment  but i ll get to that  as i have to first get the mandatory plot synopsis out of the way for the handful of people who still haven t seen the film dom cobb  leonardo dicaprio  and his team are experts in infiltrating people s dreams  they are threatened hired by japanese businessman saito  ken watanabe  to infiltrate the mind of the son of a wealthy businessman who owns a large energy conglomerate  because the son is the heir  he could dissolve the company if cobb and this team succeed in planting this idea in his head  inception  the film is basically a reverse caper style film  instead of trying to steal something  something has to be put into place now that that s out of the way  i thought i d list some of the things i liked about inception before delving into its flaws  what i liked most were the action sequences  it certainly wasn t the story or the endless plot exposition  no  inception is at heart a blockbuster and it s at its blockbuster y best when cars are turning  causing a hotel hallway inside someone s mind to also turn  sure  there are some lackluster action scenes  that ski chase   but the rest are quite creatively done and it s all due to the film s concept of inception  i also adored wally pfister s cinematography  he gave the action sequences an elegance that was only accentuated by the editing  see the car chase hallway fight scene  there s something i want to discuss concerning inception s popularity  something that kept being repeated over and over again when inception was released  was how this was an intelligent blockbuster and that precisely sums up both its pros and cons  yes  it is an unusual blockbuster  but at the same time  save for some nice practical effects during action sequences  it s also so banal and uninspired in terms of story  characters and execution  also  i think the  intelligent blockbuster  identity says something more about the audience than the film  it just screams   we can enjoy our typical summer blockbuster  whilst making ourselves believe that we are watching something intelligent and that we are intelligent for doing so   at that point  the film itself becomes irrelevant and it seems to be more about the audience s apparent need to justify their desire for summer blockbusters   no  no  it s not just a typical blockbuster  it s really deep   yeah  deep in terms of dream layers maybe  plot wise  however speaking of which  i never really understood all the constant talking of the film s  complexity  and  intelligence  when the film is actually really straightforward  this is hardly  requires repeat viewing  material  even when someone brings up the  was cobb still dreaming or not  question  i tend to think  who cares  also  that question speaks volumes of how  in the end  this film has nothing interesting to say really when you picture an action film about dreams  you start to imagine the possibilities  all kinds of surreal  symbolic imagery  perhaps hinting at characters  fears and subconscious desires  there s a reason the film s posters kept depicting the fantastic images of cities folding in on themselves  but the amount of times inception delivers on that front can be counted on one hand  you can of course argue that the film explains  as it tends to do  that these dreams are worlds created by ariadne  so that there s limited interference of the subconscious  they are controlled environments more or less  but i think that misses the point  that is simply using the story to justify the idea that the film wouldn t have been a success if it was all about the randomness of the subconscious  i can understand that too much randomness can conflict with creating a sense of forward momentum  but at the same time you re dramatically underutilizing the filmic possibilities for depicting dreams i think that s what it boils down to  wasted potential  this film could ve been so much more daring  but it s constrained by its blockbuster ambitions  its straightforward reverse caper style narrative and nolan s own penchant for ideas but lack of involving drama  again  i don t hate the film even though it really must sound like i m bashing it  and i know it s unfair to critique a film for what it isn t  it s just that  when your film deals with dreams  you will automatically be judged by how much you visually play around with that concept and saying that inception doesn t play around with dreams and the subconscious enough is quite an understatement  if nolan had dropped the boring  uninvolving melodrama and the reverse caper style narrative  it would ve freed up so much room for visual experimentation and all kinds of involving drama  then it would have really been a film about dreams  as it is  inception is a very typical  though enjoyable  action flick disguised as something it actually isn t,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9741856455802917,

when i saw the trailer for  inception  months ago  i thought i want to see this because i like all of the christopher nolan movies i ve seen  needless to say i was happy to not have co parenting duties this weekend as my 12 year old daughter would not have wanted to see this movie  i digress  i saw it this morning and thought i need to see this again even if i have to drag my kid to see it  it was that good  story is always paramount with nolan and that is why i call him the pixar of directors  he recruits the best actors and gets the best performances from them  leo was great and joe g leavitt is the perfect wing man  he s becoming  the actor s actor  because he s so good in supporting roles  michael kaine had very limited screen time  but used it well as he s done in all of his nolan movies  and the women  ellen page  marion cotillard  were strong characters who were not reduced to eye candy  hans zimmer gave me some music for the gym  i ve never said that about an instrumental movie soundtrack as i wrote in the summary  i wanted to read what people said who didn t like it  and for the life of me  it seems to be people wanting to be contrarian  it s almost like   i can t like this movie because other people tell me how great it is   the movie had something for everyone  action  suspense  drama  love  thrills  you name it  it had it  the only remote complaint is that some of the story elements and plot lines were being explained as the movie was building to a climax  but imo  that s why you see a movie again  i remember the first time i saw a movie that was so good that i had to see it again to answer more of my questions   the usual suspects  made me jump in the air and scream  holy sh t  what just happened      inception  doesn t give you a  what just happened   moment  but it gives you a hs feeling as you leave knowing that there s a director that will treat us like adults there are so many themes that all of us can relate to  family dynamics  marriage and what the vows really mean  genesis of ideas  the definition of evil  stealing subconscious thoughts ideas as a job  just as a hit man kills people  for a living i e  what is one s definition of evil  corporate greed and competition  i could go on but people that see the movie will get their own meaning or meanings from it  i ve read many reviews comparing this to  the matrix   sorry haters  they are two different films functioning on two different levels  dying in  the matrix  meant real death  dying in  inception  just woke one up or depending on the level of the dreaming  trapped one in limbo  life and death and where reality fits as opposed to reality and how the subconscious gets in the way as i have gotten older and consumed more media  movies  books  music   i ve learned that the best thing i can say about one of these consumables is that there are no throwaway scenes   inception  is the 500  1000   piece puzzle that needs every piece to be complete  if you want everything explained to you  see something else  but if you want to be encouraged to think  go see this movie  then see it again and again and again  you won t regret it,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9954859018325806, 'elapsed_time': 0.20439386367797852}",positive

it beggars belief how both critics and movie goers have been won over by this pseudo intellectual piece of garbage  really world  i thought better of you there were three key problems for me in this movie  the first was the love story  blah  i mean really  blah  this was an action based thriller  whose ultimate fate was rested on dicaprio s characters obsession with his dead wife  ultimately the film could have achieved its original thought provoking intentions had it dumped the obligatory hollywood love story entirely my second issue with this movie was the teams motivation for going into the energy tycoons son was weak  if you really want to get your audience thinking  why not try to get a politician to push through a new law  or stop the production of nuclear warheads  why focus an entire movie  so well shot and expertly produced  in trying to get someone to break down a business  finally  and maybe this was just me because i was disconnecting with the film at this point  but some of the dialogue was just way too cheesy and over the top   a dream within a dream within a dream  it s never been done before   all in all a big let down  mainly because the concept was great and some of the scenes were incredibly filmed  yet the producers bowed to the same old hollywood model  not all of us need to see a love story in order to engage our brains y know,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.03265294432640076, 'elapsed_time': 0.20073556900024414}",negative

what a great movie  i was so flabbergasted by the effects and the odd story of how a group of people use dreams to steal ideas or in fact plant ideas to others  leonardio decaprio was excellent as the man hired for the job  from a japanese business man to go inside a mans mind and plant an idea so that it can be carried out in the real world  but to do  they would have to combat silhouettes which basically are a defence mechanism to intruders  even friends or family in a persons mind can be used to kill  the effects blew me away  with the awe eye catching block folding in half  or actual sets that moved to give us the wonderful vision of a mind trap going wrong  chris nolan was fabulous in his directing  especially from the oscar winning movie the dark knight  this was by far his best achievement in scope  story  directing  and above all a great cast  i can t wait to see his next film,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9965662956237793, 'elapsed_time': 0.22510218620300293}",positive

inception  the story of corporate agents who trap their mark in an engineered  dream world  that s oddly dreary yet deafening  populated with nasty soulless projections  in which minutes seem like hours or decades  all just to rob the mark   and just when it feels the nightmare s about to end  you just find yourself in a nightmare within the nightmare  this pretty much sums up the audience experience i found inception uninteresting  too long  and absolute work to watch  while the premise was great  and the plot at least interesting  the writing  plot sequence  and execution were poor  and even the cinematography was greatly disappointing  you d think a deliberately constructed dream world would be fantastic   it was merely drear  deafeningly loud  bland  stark  and depressing   even when it was monumental  it had a decidedly stalinist architectural quality  i realize that people  supposedly  dream in black n white     but did they have to make almost everything grey and dingy  virtually all of the  fantastic  clips shown in the trailers happen in the first 30 minutes  in the great  70  minute  finale the only visually interesting and original bit is the 0 gravity fight scene as the hall tumbles around them the climax seemed interminable  but ceased to be suspenseful about 10 minutes in  all the supporting cast   with the arguable exception of caine   were complete ciphers  mere 2 dimensional shadows you couldn t give a damn about  the descent into dream limbo to rescue their employer made no sense given what was explained about the nature of dream invasions  just whose dream were they entering  it was not dicaprio s character s  so why are they stuck in his deep subconscious      unless of course it was all really just his nightmare to begin with in the end  the whole movie only makes sense if it really is all the main character s unending nightmare  unfortunately  it proved a nightmare for me  i know thousands of brain dead  hype fed  viewers who imagine themselves intelligent and deep  felt differently  but my actual nightmares are more interesting  less painful to endure  and considerably cheaper,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.004218762274831533, 'elapsed_time': 0.22902536392211914}",negative

my feelings about this movie is probably best illustrated by the southpark episode  insheeption   just because a film is complex  doesn t mean it s good or cool making a film more complex and multi layered doesn t necessarily make it a deeper and more engaging film  in the case of inception  it generally only makes it more complex  and not in a way that is to the film s merit the complixity gets in the way of the film s plot a lot  which is quite frankly  not that complicated i can only call the film  an overly complex  though decent film  that just insists too much upon itself  it s a decent film and although graded equally on imdb  it does not deserve to be amongst the likes of the shawnshank redemption and the godfather,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9886444807052612, 'elapsed_time': 0.2157611846923828}",positive

where do i start with inception  to delve into the plot would actually take away the film s effectiveness but say too little and it begs the purpose of this review at all  so  on that note  there will be certain  but non major  plot points spoken about  some very minor spoilers  again  not plot ruining  but if you wish to go in knowing as little as possible  which is the best way  trust me   then it might be worth skipping the review dicaprio is a gent called dom cobb  the best extractor in the business of subconscious espionage  extraction is easy  however when dom is asked to attempt inception  the tricky practice of planting an idea into their target s mind  it is explained why it s more difficult but i can t explain it here   the stakes are raised much higher  there s the promise of finally getting home to his family  of whom he has been in hiding for an undisclosed but lengthy period of time one thing to say about inception  apart from how truly  utterly brilliant it is  is that it is probably the most original film since the matrix back in 1999  i think one of the key components that will either invigorate audiences or turn them off is the fact that it s not based on an already established name  be it an adaptation or a sequel  that in itself is refreshing enough but the genius conceit of inception is that it believes so much in the world it s created that it leaves very little catching up time for the audience  the rules for extraction and inception are laid down thick and fast and woe betide the fellow that insists on a pee break  miss even two minutes of this film and you re lost but in laying down the rules  the second half of the film  in which dicaprio s team implement the inception heist  acts them out with aplomb  we have dreams within dreams within dreams and things that happen in one plain of reality directly effect that in the next  for example  whilst the team is unconscious in freefall in one  in the subsequent dream they re all weightless  and whilst a van in which the team is asleep tumbles down a hill  the gravity in the next starts to shift  giving us that awesome corridor fight from the trailer  christopher nolan really has taken everything he s learned from making mature adult blockbusters and utilised it here with maximum effect  to say it s thinking man s blockbuster is understating things but  unlike the michael bay s of this world  he does not feel the need to treat his audience like kids  whilst inception may hold a 12a certificate  that s not to say it s for children of that age  not because of any of its content i must add  just that the plot  which is perfectly written and executed  will just be too much for those that crave robots hitting each other but  that said  there is a lot here that will appeal to that demographic  the visuals  whether it is during much of the trippy dream imagery or the outstanding action sequences  are spectacular  whilst grounding much of the dream world in reality  that s not to stop paris from folding in on itself or have gravity shifting from wall to wall but  as stated  what makes inception work is it stubbornness to stick to it s established rules  so ten hours in real time equates to a week in the dream world but a dream within that dream equates to six months and a dream within that dream equates to ten years and so on  so whilst moments that are instantaneous in one dream  the team knows that they ll have around twenty minutes to get things done in the next  etc  once you get your head around it  you have to marvel at how well the filmmakers have been able to juggle the different time frames within the dream world  it pays off in spade and once everything comes together in the end  of which it does in outstanding fashion  the satisfaction of staying with nolan and his convoluted but never confusing mind is like nothing i ve experienced in the cinema for years inception is literally like nothing you ve ever seen before  a heist movie with some serious balls  this is  hands down  christopher nolan s finest accomplishment  there will be those that wont like it  it has already garnered some vehemently hostile criticism  and i can understand why but i was enthralled by not only the spectacle but also the sheer bravura at its ideas this is nolan s masterpiece,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9932864904403687, 'elapsed_time': 0.23483848571777344}",positive

have you ever managed to remember the beginning of a dream  somethings stated in this film were small but true statements  the bizarre things that happen in a dream only appear weird when you wake up  the mind is constantly justifying your mental image with reality in so saying  christopher nolan s 10 years in the making idea offers true science fiction with an all star ensemble cast which in my opinion is noteworthy in its self  i ve always been of the opinion that you put too many stars in one movie it usually saturates it with personality conflicts that ooze onto the big screen and lessen the experience   the scope  both in depth and presentation show that it was loved and nursed from concept with just enough technology to create a world that would comfortably accommodated one foot in cold reality and one foot in womb of dream  the good thing is that you can appreciate the movie without intimately following the plot  the bad thing is that you can get very lost if you need to use the facilities  the use of dreams is not a new idea as a vehicle to present a story  i guess the closest thing that would compare to it for me would be  the matrix   what matrix misses though is  and rightfully so is humanity  where matrix is program driven  inception is almost completely driven by primal needs and the vehicle that fuels it was developed by none other than the military  once the tools to define and control the dream life of a human being fall into the hands of a special  underground  group of people  then we start seeing the dangers of manipulating the fabric of time and space  for dicaprio s portrayal of cobb with a dark secret and the mission job he has been offered that would allow this dark secret to be at peace  the focus is set  and mind you  pay attention because it is easy to loose your perspective through the multiplicity of the story  i am a baby boomer  and as such a person who see s retirement within reach have memories of shows like the original mission impossible  inception follows the mission impossible time line closely  1  you have a potential customer that has an interest in your product and you let him sample it  out of this  he hires you to do a specific job  however  it goes further than you normally go   which is you are not just getting information willingly out of a target  but also implanting an idea so he believes in the end it is his own  the game is a foot  2  you assemble your team  you find an architect  an apothecary  a forger  weapons master    etc  3  you find your best option for deploying your plan  4  you initiate your plan  5  you improvise as needs fit in adverse conditions  6  you accomplish your goal  7  you all depart with slight nods and smiles as you move on to bigger and better things i have seen this now twice  which for me was necessary  some things just didn t make sense to me at the start but came clear during a second sitting  2 5 hours long too    so don t drink all your water or eat all your popcorn in the first 30 minutes  or use the facilities during the movie   the only teaser i will part is that the ending justifies the job  please  don t take children to this movie  it is dark  the music is repetitive and builds throughout the movie  reminded me almost of a 007 theme   there are lots of surprise explosions that are loud   i say this because some stupid 30 year old man bought an 8 month old infant to the theater and sat in the second row from the screen  my opinion he should have been locked up for his arrogant selfishness  this movie is also offered with d box motion seat signal which is kind of entertaining  we sat in the row in front of the d box section and the floor was constantly vibrating during loud sequences  the experience of this film for me was a 10  the plot was a 10  the acting was a 9 as was the music  the fx were seamless and a 9 another must see in the theater a list  enjoy   b,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9970695972442627, 'elapsed_time': 0.2299797534942627}",positive

films are fictions of a director  based on a story  the story may be an existing story  a book  a true story  or pure fantasy  a film should always have a meaning  worth watching and must relate to the logic  to the reasoning of the viewers  to make films more interesting and challenging for the experienced viewer  directors may use different techniques like reversing or mixing the chronological sequence of scenes and temporarily confusing the viewer with dream scenes  these techniques should not be used just to make the movie more  difficult  or more  intellectual   they should add an artistic value to the story  if you d take away these  tricks   you should still have left a solid story   inception  is a bit different in the sense that the dream technique is maybe more important than the story  maybe it is the story  here the dreams are deliberately directionally started by an obscure apparatus in a suitcase and some wires  dreams that function on different levels or layers  each with some logical  preponderant illogical characteristics  but all very realistic  confusing dreams and reality  not only for the viewer  but also for the characters  that s the good part  the bad part is that the logic of the story is completely lost  we are watching a pudding of in itself highly attractive action scenes on different dream levels  in strange ways interacting with themselves  the actions are the results of what the principle characters dream up  we guess  then why so much fuzz  so much bustle  and why not dream up a less complicated and less violent way to find your wife and children  which are dead  alive or only exist in you dreams  dreams are uncontrollable  you might say  that is true  but the essence of this movie is  that the dreams in this movie are controllable  that is why this movie is not honest and does not touch your feelings  it is just a sequence of impressive actions  served with an intellectual intended sauce of dream states which after some researching do not make a lot of sense  my idea is that the high reviews on the imdb site have to do with viewers that are accustomed to video games  which use these concepts of complicated means of finding the solution or goal  for them it is all about the game  not about logic  reasoning and films that move you,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9871764183044434, 'elapsed_time': 0.1493537425994873}",positive
based on most reviews so far  it would appear that we indeed have an instant classic here  but it is not so  here are a few reasons  which others probably are forgetting in the after glow of seeing a more rare film   or simply this is a good indication that good films are dying out and anything a bit out of the ordinary is a  gem   comparisons to matrix are ludicrous  btw  anyhow  a few of those points  and most of them can be related to some sloppy writing  i believe     the plot is simpler than what it seems  and is helped along the way with introduction of simplistic rules such as  a 5 minute in reality is 1 hour in dream state  on the first level  etc   come on     the only driving motive of the main protagonist is none other but  to return to my kids   oh  how original       in these writers  world  the guys who perform the dirty deeds of the utmost sophistication  breaking in people s subconscious   for the likewise dirty corporations  have the cutest kids on the block  and we are somehow to root for this guy in his struggle to get back to those kids    in the same fashion  the whole plot rests on about a two sentence dialogue  whereby one corporate magnate persuades the main protagonist to get on with the inception mission  because their competitor would otherwise become very powerful    there s a serious over indulgence in action scenes  which  true  are executed very well   but the whole film clocking at 147 minutes is mostly due to these stretched action scenes  which don t bring much new    the whole story becomes convoluted to the point of messy  where the story first evolves around the inception  then becomes survival  then becomes resolution of the main protagonist subconscious conflicts  with a lot of bang bang on top of everything else    there are some good  mind bending  scenes  the shame is they are all shown in the movie trailer   when will they stop this practice       ariadne  aka the architect  proves her role on the team through her skills  which are later on not utilized very much  overall  this character is badly structured  with added fact that her big mythological name is all there is to the mythology side of things  her only purpose that seems to remain was to move the story at a key moment  when the whole team is ready to  terminate the mission   which was not all that convincing    the sub plot around the main protagonists and his wife is fairly interesting  but the resolution in him leaving her felt like some kind of escape writing  now how do we end this so we can move the story on     i am usually very keen to forgive such minute detail as the number of shots fired and missed  but in here  it was bordering on ridiculous all in all  this is an action movie  with sci fi elements  as opposed to being a sci fi movie with action movie elements  i believe it is mostly catering to a crowd of late teenagers  and thus doesn t become very elaborate in terms of background philosophy  psychology etc  but rather becomes very action movie oriented  i perceived it as a good fun for the moment  but nothing terribly memorable  it felt like a good idea  going in  but the film doesn t deliver on a more subtle  but deeper layer  where for example a much more memorable movies like matrix delivered so well  i would advise a more serious movie fan  after inevitable seeing this movie  to look elsewhere for similar concepts and compare    being john malkovich  for excellent depiction of  collapsing into one s subconsciuos  and the whole story of messing with someone s mindwaking life  for excellent depiction of what it truly means to no longer distinguish which is reality and which is dreammemento  for excellent depiction of messing up one s memory and where it might lead,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.39838719367980957, 'elapsed_time': 0.13684606552124023}",negative

ten years he did about this story  christopher nolan  i hardly understand what is so difficult to understand about this would be intellectual piece of rubbish about a dream within a dream within a dream  this is just what night m shyamalan has done in all of his movies  boring us to death with a boring story for about 9 10th of the movie and then to give us an  amazing ending   the ending here being that in fact it is not a three layered dream but about a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream so 4 layers  at least that s what my impression is as the spinning thing at the end is the talisman of either the wife or leonard di caprio from the trailer this seemed to be a brilliant movie but i should have been warned by my colleagues from work  one leaving the theater before the ending and all of the others not understanding what the fuss was all about and right they are before this year i never believed that leonardo di caprio was able to play adult characters  if any at all  after watching titanic years ago  now i m dead sure of it after watching shutter island and inception this year characters without character so you don t give a damn about them  endless ridiculously action scenes certainly towards the end working to an action climax that is incredibly foreseeable  dream layers ending at the same time   heavy pseudo sophisticated acting that gets on your nerves quickly  in one sentence  the biggest scam since the matrix though the wachowski brothers are even bigger crooks as they scammed the world three times  what idiots us the public are  are we not  i have no problem with  amazing ending  movies at least if they would make the effort to give you a story leading up to it  here there is none i agree there are really serious bad things to get offended about in the world  but when we feel offended in real life about being conned with situations or a product  we should be too when we are scammed in the movie theater the 1 point i give for this movie is for the  street bending  special effect  the other effects being rather tedious and pure special effects for the effect,"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5550774335861206, 'elapsed_time': 0.1569509506225586}",neutral

"i recently rewatched inception and  as the title says  it was much better than i remembered  now  you have to understand  when i first watched inception it was one of the best movies i ve ever watched  so topping that was an accomplishment  this movie has so many layers to it  and the two and a half hours pass by quickly there are so many great things about inception  the best way to describe it is a modern classic  hans zimmer does a stunning soundtrack  as always  with these loud air horn noises that apparently were written into the script  in recent years this movie  and really nolan movies in general  have begun to receive some criticism  people are beginning to complain that inception has too much exposition delivered through dialogue  now  there probably was some better way of delivering the exposition  but just think about how lost we would all be without it  i didn t fully understand the movie until my second watch  and even then i m sure there s a thousand things that i missed  for me the exposition passes by quickly and i really don t mind due to how well crafted the rest of the movie is 
the screenplay of inception is also fantastic  the way the story progresses through the layers of the dream  the fact that it s all so consistent with itself  the fascinating story  the character moments  it makes sense why this screenplay took nolan so many years to write  the directing  visuals  and editing of the movie all enhance the screenplay and bring this whole thing together  a fantastic example that s been talked about many times over the years is the hallway scene that was all done practically  it blows my mind that they built a spinning hallway and trained actors to do an action scene within it  it shows the incredible lengths christopher nolan will go to to make his movies look great  the first time i watched this movie  i didn t realize that this is really a psychological thriller  inception puts a lot of it s focus  literally  on cobb s subconscious  another thing that hit me hard on the second viewing was fischer s side of the story  the first time  i didn t fully grasp how the whole inception went down  on my second viewing  it was really powerful  they made fischer convince himself that his father actually loved him and wanted him to be his own man  and that culminated with the phenomenal vault scene  the worst part of all of this is that fischer s father probably didn t love him  it was all made up  on top of this  cillian murphy gives an incredible performance like i ve said before  this movie works exceptionally well on a rewatch  most of what i ve talked about only became apparent on a second viewing  i m sure the more i watch this movie the more i ll love it  there s one big part of inception that really works though  and that s that the movie is just really entertaining  all of the action scenes are intense  the runtime and pacing is perfect  the performances are all wonderful  and the couple of jokes thrown in there get a laugh out of you  you re trying to wrap your mind around the complexity of the story  but it s all so much fun to do  there are some complex movies out there that just aren t as entertaining as inception  even though they may be smart  i think that s really what still has people talking about it to this day  it s fun to rewatch not only because of the complexity  but it never loses entertainment value my thoughts on the ending of inception are that the top stops spinning  cobb isn t dreaming  but as many people know this doesn t matter  cobb stops questioning his reality and embraces his kids whether he s dreaming or not  i think that christopher nolan intended for it to not matter  but he cut to black to keep the discussion going  as you can tell  people are still talking about this movie ten years after its release  and people are still debating if the top keeps spinning or not  i think the best part of this movie is that christopher nolan makes you question reality  the point he was making was that reality is so important to us  and throughout this entire movie  all the action scenes  the beautiful score  the incredible performances  there is one thing we take away  a forever spinning top  the image is burned into our minds  and the real accomplishment is that nolan managed to perform an inception on the viewers by causing us to question our own reality  for me  the two times i ve watched this movie i ve had very vivid dreams for a few nights afterward  nolan made me question my reality  this realization is what made me love this movie even more  one very simple idea  planted in the depths of our mind  exactly as cobb did to mal  he spun the top 10 10 masterpiece my rating system 1 10  hot garbage

went to see it today and came out of the cinema very disappointed  borderline angry    i have to admit though that my expectations were too big for what is after all just another summer blockbuster  first the story  you d call it original if someone like philip k dick had never existed  thing is  he really existed  we could question that after all  that would probably please both dick and nolan    sigh and he wrote dozens of books on the subject  which makes this movie anything but original storytelling wise  also the movie is far too long  they should have cut off at least 30 45 minutes  almost fell asleep at the 1h30 point  the scenario is not even well thought  sometimes even incoherent and the director tries to hide its weaknesses with lots sfx and gunshots  i m especially thinking about the last  jump  to go to the limbos  it s not the 4th level as there s no 4th level in the architect plans  the limbos  as previously told during the movie  is the place you end up in when you die in the dream and can t wake up in real life  so why is it suddenly possible for them to get there without dying    and don t serve me the  they go in cobb s mind  crap  i don t buy it  good points in the movie   sfx  i loved paris folding on itself  cast  thank god there were good actors in that movie    all in all not such a bad movie  but certainly not a masterpiece of sheer originality  5 10 would be my note if it wasn t so over hyped  i chose to give 3 10 to strike back on the sheep giving it a ten when it certainly does not deserve it at all,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.025272997096180916, 'elapsed_time': 0.136549711227417}",negative

every now and then a movie comes along that is so far superior to the average film it takes your breath away and reminds you why you love movies  inception does that and more not since the matrix  1999  has a movie exploded onto the scene like inception leaving an awed audience in absolute chills having witnessed something so fresh  so unique  so thought provoking and deep that the experience lasts long after the credits roll  it s more than a movie  it s artistic expression at its finest blending beautiful imagery  powerful music  relentless intensity  riveting plot  mesmerizing ideas and heart wrenching emotions  all while captivating an imagination in a fresh and unique way there are aspects of this movie that simply have not been attempted before  there are images and visuals that before existed only inside ones imagination or dreams  there are spellbinding manipulations of the space time continuum altering preconceived notions of reality without any spoilers i will say that the primary vehicle for the plot encompasses the mysterious world of dreams  specifically the notion of extracting or implanting information or ideas within ones dream  the way in which this topic is approached is highly intriguing in and of itself  but there is so much more to this movie than just dreams this is a story about guilt  love  redemption  letting go  contentment  curiosity  creativity  acceptance  desires  choices  consequences  priorities and approval  the role children play in our lives and the enormous responsibility and influence we have in theirs was a particularly meaningful theme of the film for me  there are some very touching scenes that will certainly stay with you long after the movie however  what s so refreshing is the manner in which this story is told  we are provided with the least amount of information necessary in order to follow along and be emotionally invested  some might find this creates confusion and unanswered questions  i find it creates a crisp  intelligent and thought inspiring story without falling prey to the annoying and all too common practice of over explanation found in most movies today  i don t need or want every little thing explained to me over and over again  this is a movie that demands multiple viewings  some things are left up to interpretation  but many of the so called unanswered questions will be answered by watching it a second time  at least that was my experience i also really like how the movie doesn t try to be noble or grand  no one is trying to save the world or conquer an evil enemy  it s a basic plot  but it s just told on a grand scale in a very entertaining and unique way  the primary motivations of both the protagonist and the person that hires him to do a job that makes up the bulk of the storyline is very simple and relatable  one is trying to overcome an obstacle to get home and the other is trying to advance his own power and influence  but neither is presented as either good or bad  as an audience we don t know if the results that occur if the mission succeeds will have a positive or negative impact on the world  we are simply told what is necessary and important  we can fill in the rest as we see fit  and how each individual viewer chooses to see the movie will largely be influenced by their own personal biases and their  projections  used to fill in the blanks  those that have seen the movie just caught my intentional use of the word  projections  and can probably guess where i m heading next this leads me to the true brilliance of the movie  inception isn t just occurring in the movie  it s occurring to the audience  we become part of the subject matter  those that have seen the end of the movie know what i m referring to  i won t go into any detail  but i will say this  a single idea in the human mind is a very powerful thing  keep that in mind  not while watching the movie  but afterwards while analyzing it  you might be surprised what you discover i ll end by saying that christopher nolan is fast becoming the greatest director of his generation  dark knight is the pinnacle of the superhero genre  i thought that would be nolan s masterpiece  i was wrong  inception is his greatest masterpiece to date  nolan has skyrocketed into my top 10 all time favorite directors and leonardo dicaprio is fast becoming one of the most accomplished actors of any generation  at age 35 he has already squeezed in a lifetime worth of quality films working with the top directors in the industry  and i think he hasn t even hit his peak yet  in another 35 years don t be surprised if he s widely considered to be on the short list of greatest actors ever  not bad for the little trouble maker punk kid on growing pains and i certainly can t forget the amazing musical score by composer hans zimmer  the music in this movie is absolutely one of the characters  it s engrossing and completely elevates the entire experience  it s beautiful  right now i can t think of a better movie score  and i m a movie score connoisseur  like the movie itself  you will not be able to get the music out of your head finally  allow me to take this opportunity to announce that there is a new  1 on the very top of my all time favorite movies  i never thought braveheart could be eclipsed  but i never imagined a movie like inception  since i ve seen the movie multiple times i don t feel this is simply a reactionary decision  i ve put a lot of thought into it  anyone that knows me knows that i take my  favories  of anything very seriously do yourself a favor and go

i was profoundly disappointed because a so called masterpiece like the movie inception would be an overrated action flick of mediocrity  inception is far from a masterpiece  it is not intelligent nor mind blowing  with a shallow story  plot holes all over the place  uninteresting characters and bad cinematography  the movie proves one thing  that a basic  undeveloped  but polished idea  is enough to get loved by people and capitalize hundreds of millions with the help of expensive cgis and tons of dumbfounded action first off  the concept  the movie was simply able to get away with various inconsistencies and poor world building because of its shallow idea developments and lack of specificity  while the idea of  a dream within a dream  is a cool concept  the movie never spends time setting up all the fundamentals and world building  how does it work  do you just plug yourself in and create everything  what can you control in a dream  how far is the scope of imagination  if you can just imagine a bazooka to kill your enemies  can t you just heal yourself  if you go deeper to three or four dream levels  how do you perceive time and think thousands of times as normal without overworking or blowing your brains out  all these work on kids  logic  that you can imagine anything  and things would just miraculously operate in an inexplicable way you want  oh look  turn away  here s a one hour action sequence with a van slow motionally falling into water  a guy walking around the hallways with zero gravity and explosions and killing and massive cgis  ha  bet you didn t notice all those inconsistencies did ya now  to the ending  let s not kid ourselves  that wasn t twisty and mind blowing at all  okay  he was still living in a dream at the end  so what  if mal kills herself and wakes up  wouldn t she wake him up too  why is he still here  why do they show him fly to america  hack into that guys  mind  they wake up many times still being in a dream  the twist doesn t mean anything and offers no one closure or meaning to the story  oops no time to explain that since we already skipped all the world building at the beginning  when everyone wakes up at the end  the dream machine with all the strings has already disappeared so they have no risk of getting caught by the rich guy whether most of the actors were miscast  have bad acting  or bad writing  the characters have no personality nor attraction for me at all  joseph gordon levitt brings out no other dynamics than his straight serious cop face like in  the dark knight rises   ellen page s character is unconvincing  who looks confused and worried for the whole movie  her voice is flat out without emotions and her mouth constantly moves unproportionately to her face as if she s reading from a textbook  everyone in the movie delivers lines like robots talking about math  however  this is not to include that most of these lines are redundant  and repeating to the audience with information that were already given in the previous scenes the film holds no impact  no momentum  supposedly emotional and introduction scenes were rushed through and action sequences were stretched out obnoxiously long  even the scenes with cobb and mal were boring and unimpactful  no stakes were set  cobb s reason to get back to his kids  which is really not that important since we don t know how close he is to them  seems to be stressed more than everyone falling in a permanent brain dead state  nolan tried to cram all the unimportant technical information and characters into the film and forgot to tell a good and fulfilling story with that being said  i refuse to recognize this movie as anything near to good or masterpiece,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.010347261093556881, 'elapsed_time': 0.14447021484375}",negative

first off i think it s important to state one thing  i am a fan of christoper nolan s work  i think  the dark knight  is one the best films of the decade  his follow up however while visually exciting wastes a lot of potential  the ideas is very intriguing but nolan doesn t explore it to it s full potential  i mean we are talking about manipulating dreams here  they could have had bullets flying out of their eyeballs or fingertips  for that matter why use bullets at all  this is the same problem i had with the vastly overrated matrix  the world of dreams is by its very nature illusory and vague  people say something feels dreamlike but the only thing that is ever truly dreamlike is a dream  hitchcock s  spellbound  with it s brilliant sets by salvador dali and wes craven s original  nightmare on elm street  are in my opinion the best portrayals of the world of the subconscious  craven in particular with the lighting and camera angles really gave it a dreamlike feel  nolan is a visually interesting filmmaker but here he misses the mark  however one misfire doesn t mean the end of him or his career  all good directors have had the occasional dud  does anyone remember spielberg s  1941  nolan is a good director who has made good films in the past  one film does not define him  people who rate this as a masterpiece are looking at it through the haze of fanboy admiration for nolan s earlier work  judge it independently as you must with every film  nolan has made good movies in the past and will do so again  this one however while visually dynamic falls short on story  and the surprise ending hardly original  bottom line fast paced action but not nearly as visually interesting as it could be,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9899125099182129, 'elapsed_time': 0.14627361297607422}",positive

despite being only in his early forties  christopher nolan continues to make genre films of the rarest kind  his films  usually written with his brother jonathan  are regularly developed from existing conventional story archetypes  yet he continues to raise the bar for genre films by populating his films with complex portraits of fractured men and his insistence in exploring their troubled identities  it is this emphasis on character and emotion  as much as visual flair  which elevates his films beyond the regular wave of mainstream hollywood cinema  following from the phenomenal success of the dark knight  one of the best films of 2008  the expectations for nolan and inception have been immense  he has spent almost a decade writing the screenplay and the result is an exhilarating but completely different animal to the dark knight  whereas that film was a polished and near perfect arch of an action film  subtly including post 911 allusions  inception remains a far more complex and challenging assignment for both its director and its audience  one of the most intriguing questions raised throughout this film is whether one can manufacture inspiration in the minds of others  it is a difficult and unfamiliar concept  particularly when combined with the task of establishing characters that are foreign to us  it is to the credit of nolan as both a screenwriter and a skilled director that he explores this puzzling question with clarity  intelligence and exciting visuals  inception is one of the best films of the year as with all of nolan s other pictures  inception plays with the existing conventions of a particular genre  this is essentially a heist movie with a slightly more problematic structure  the film  at least on initial viewing  seems to develop over only two acts rather than three  it quickly establishes the team without any overlong episodes of finding them and then the inception itself begins  the film thankfully cuts out any needless exposition about the technology that allows cobb to infiltrate the dreams  instead  the focus remains on the frequent and exciting action sequences and cobb s own sense of tragic guilt  the visual effects here are on the whole inspiring to see on the silver screen  yet as amazing as it is to see an entire city torn apart in slow motion it is even more exciting to see how the dream world  and sometimes the dream within that dream  balance precariously because of cobb s subconscious  as certain factors threaten the validity of the dream  for much of the film s ambiguity  it is striking how immersive and involved one becomes in realising how dangerous the threats are to the mission  drastically enhancing our engagement and the overall tension of the film  although inception may start in a highly confusing manner  it rewards viewers for their persistence by gradually revealing its secrets to the outsider in ariadne and thus the audience  without it ever seeming contrived  with the exception of some overly long snow sequences the film is superbly told and its running time over two and a half hours soars by despite his strengths with visual designs and special effects  nolan still realises the importance of humanity in genre films  in order to keep the audience emotionally involved with the characters  cobb is nolan s flawed and tragic hero here and dicaprio gives a powerful performance  one of the best of a distinguished career  his slightly monotone  whispery voice feels entirely fitting for the dreamscape and he applies the appropriate amount of intensity  as opposed to his exhausting role in shutter island earlier this year  it is testimony to the power of dicaprio s efforts that the revelation about cobb and his wife becomes a surprisingly poignant but ultimately disturbing new layer in the film s complex plot  although we do not learn about the back story of the other characters  all of the other actors here still give fine performances that regularly asserts their vulnerability and thus their humanity  marion has a deadly presence on screen as the film s disruptor and ellen page is an appropriately skeptical and scared outsider  amidst so many complex ideas it would perhaps be overbearing to include a lot of exposition about the other characters  so it is forgivable that we do not learn more about the team inception may not seem as satisfying as a the dark knight because it takes the audience out of their comfort zones and their expectations for a particular genre  it confuses and disorientates  sets the audience on its feet and then throws them into disarray again  yet even with its multiple threads  it still manages to be a completely compelling  original and exciting action film  with a powerful emotion core  it is testimony to the direction of the actors that they inspire humanity amidst the most absurd and abstract ideas  this is an extremely enjoyable genre film  overflowing in its concepts and its ambition  soaring with moments of exhilaration and tension  if there was any doubt  christopher nolan is now one of hollywood s most significant mainstream filmmakers since steven spielberg,"{'label':

a few years back when i saw the dark knight  i thought now thats what made me fall in love with hollywood  however  inception made me remember what sheer brilliance this movie industry can create and puts it worlds apart from our bollywood shock and awe      that sums up my experience  as many have already said this is nolan s masterpiece  the cgi just took it to the next level  i don t favour the recent 3d trend and i thank the producers for not doing something like that to this movie  but considering the story and cinematography i wouldn t have minded  if they had the acting is not the strongest part of this movie  most of the characters have very little to showcase in this movie  yet  joseph gordon lewitt ken watanabe  marion cotillard did justice to their roles  leonardo dicaprio s character was the only thing that had some weight and he performed brilliantly   i wish he gets an oscar nod at least   brilliance is the only word that can define his performances these days nolan has become the go to guy for many new projects for warner bros  these days and this is just proof of why it is so  the way this movie has been presented  i cannot give it another name rather than a masterpiece  it shakes you  makes you think and amazes you with the effects  the performances and the story  nolan deserves every credit that he gets for making such a beautiful and mind boggling movie the reason i compare it to matrix is because it makes you think and imagine beyond your normal horizon  it actually requires you to sit and take in everything that is given so that you can enjoy it to the fullest the reason why i love it even more is because these days with movies like twilight and all in which you don t have to use your head  this one actually titillates your mind and senses  now usually when i see such a movie i d suggest everyone of my friends to check it out  but i caution you to only go watch this movie if you plan to take your brain with you  it ain t that  keep your head out of the theatre  movie  so if you end up disliking it  its purely due to lack of concentration it s simple you would either call it ridiculously awesome or just plain ridiculous  it all depends on you the special effects are outrageous  leonardo dicaprio is as usual unbelievable  the action sequence is thrilling  nolan has gone over the top  yet  what everyone should look out for is  the story note  i haven t seen paprika and many have complained about it not being credited  i cant say if that is right or wrong  however i personally believe that no anime has yet found a better big screen extravaganza  all i can ask  is for nolan to watch death note  we d all love that  wouldn t we the best part  the climax of the movie was the best  i have seen in ages  the audience is devastated  amazed  given hope  rejoiced  then practically left jaw dropped and hung  asking just one question  was that a dream,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9852950572967529, 'elapsed_time': 0.22864866256713867}",positive
inception is a failure and a disappointment  it s mostly an excuse to include action sequences that  it turns out  the story doesn t require  the film s trailer looked and sounded better that the film itself  the film is ambitious but in director christopher nolan s hands it just doesn t work  like in his batman films nolan spends too much time on showing the preparations before the main course  in this case it s finding the team members  explaining what they do  and then what should be done  when all this starts to seem boring and unbelievable an action scene is included  on top of this the film s concept seems phoney  it s never really explained how several people can enter the one dream  in this case the audience has to abandon reason and just go along with it  even so  the film still doesn t deliver  i didn t like most of the team members because they weren t necessary and because the actors were miscast  i only liked leonardo dicaprio s dom cobb and joseph gordon levitt s arthur  except for these two there weren t any good performances  scenes that were supposed to be filled with emotion or grandeur fall flat  for the most part  ellen page s ariadne is the architect  she s shown working on paper models of buildings  but then the team enters the dream world that she designed   and wow   it s a fully realized city with countless details  fantasy is absent from these dreams though  you won t find godzilla there somewhere  but you will find several gunmen  except for a few instances  attempts at deep meaning and characterization don t work  the film is also long  it goes on and on and doesn t entertain  the second half is comprised mostly of one action scene after another  and most of these are just shootouts there s a lot that s wrong with inception  but some things in it are sort of right  it works as a noir thriller  the cinematography is quite good  two parts of the film that i most looked forward to seeing were a little impressive  one is when arthur fights against a few gunmen in the hallway of a building while the center of gravity keeps changing  this was a good idea for a fight  but the fight lasts for like a minute  it s also not as impressive as the batpod scene from the dark knight  2008   the second part that i liked was the dream world that cobb and his wife mallorie designed for themselves  that city was definitely awe inspiring  too little time was spent there too  however  nolan should be given credit for trying something new but very little of it is interesting  his previous film  the dark knight  was good but much overrated  his direction remains cold  it s solid but uninspired  like dicaprio s previous film  shutter island  2010   inception has its moments  in the end  however  it s totally pointless  some reviewers called inception a masterpiece  in their case they don t know what a masterpiece is or they re deceiving themselves  this film is nowhere near a masterpiece  i guess it didn t help that i watched a masterwork like the godfather part ii on the night before i went to see inception in the theaters  in the godfather everything feels like it belongs  and the film has real meaning  in the theater i could tell that most of the audience didn t like the film  one woman kept looking around to see how others were reacting to it  i don t recommend inception  it s just another pointless summer blockbuster  it tries to be smart but fails  much of it was influenced by great japanese anime like paprika  2006  and akira  1988   see the anime instead,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.09805245697498322, 'elapsed_time': 0.26508617401123047}",negative

cobb is an extractor  one of an elite group of people who are hired to go into people s subconscious  and steal their deepest secrets through their dreams  simple enough  right     wrong  on their first mission in the film cobb and the team mess up and they fail to get the very information they need  however  the mark who they try to extract from was impressed by their skills and offers cobb and his team a job  not of extraction  but inception  the planting of an idea rather than it s removal  while some say it can t be done  others around cobb  say it can  with the carrot dangling in front of cobb of returning to america and seeing his children  something he cannot do  cobb and his crew decide to take on this  hopefully  last job and return to the us rich and free  by creating a dream  within a dream  within a dream  but  of course  certain things do not go to plan so  is inception better than dark knight  everyone asks that like it s a tough question and yet it wouldn t be difficult not to be really  the grand idea s of dreams and reality  what is real or not is not bent to fit a genre like they were for dark knight  resulting in characters that had little to do with the origins on the page  here the characters and ideas come straight from nolan and he shows here  like he did in memento he is often better when he does that  although that said i am a fan of batman begins  dicaprio shows here again just what a damn fine actor he is becoming and the film hangs on his ability to make cobb so brilliant  yet hiding a truly disturbing flaw  that sucks us into the movie  almost perfectly  i ll get back to that later   support in gordon levitt as arthur is excellent and provides a serious practicality to proceedings as one of those who controls the dreams that they enter  marion cotillard is as good as she s ever been previously as cobb s late wife who can t let go of cobb s subconscious  with tom hardy and tom beringer being excellent in their more diminutive roles  the usual nolan stalwarts of caine and murphy also provide their usual skilled selves to proceedings  the direction is for the most part brilliant and assured as the pacey script lets nolan show his ample talent for story telling  although the direction on the snow action is tough as you don t know who or what is where sometimes so  great enjoyment  right  well yes  one of the best films ever    er  well no  sadly the film has its persian flaw and that is that it is too clever for its own good  i found myself looking for clues to see if this was a dream constructed by cobb  as his wife suggested  or reality as he suggested and 2 clues stood out a mile to prevent me enjoying the piece as much as i might if that was not on my mind  cobb never has his own anchor in reality  instead carrying his wife s indicating he does not have an anchor on reality  also the dream timescale the chemist speaks of doesn t work unless you re already at least one layer down  and because i was always looking for the dream within a dream i couldn t let myself go and get sucked in and fooled the way i have with other films  if you read other reviews here many are either yes it s a masterpiece enthusiasm or no it s just awful  it s like these reviews are written by spock or kirk  with reality being somewhere in between it is a good movie  it s not the best movie ever  and in my opinion mon is actually the hero trying to save cobb  the villain  from the prison that is his own mind,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.980889081954956, 'elapsed_time': 0.13803720474243164}",positive

christopher nolan s one of the best directors working today  so my expectations were understandably high for his latest  inception  even with hefty expectations  i was still blown away  i ll need to see it one or two more times to unravel all of the plot intricacies  but i honestly believe that this is nolan s best film to date  yes  i think that inception s better than the dark knight and memento  i adore the dark knight and memento  so this isn t just high praise  it s astronomical here s a brief plot summary  dom cobb  leonardo dicaprio  is a corporate espionage agent with a very specific area of expertise  stealing people s ideas through their dreams  dom and his partner arthur  joseph gordon levitt  are hired by their previous target saito  ken watanabe  to perform an even more difficult task  inception  the planting of an idea in someone s subconscious to the point where they believe it to be their own  dom assembles his team  researcher arthur  architect ariadne  ellen page   forger eames  tom hardy   chemist yusef  dileep rao  and saito himself  who is tagging along to protect his investment  however  dom s subconscious could threaten the entire team  especially with the memory of his wife mal  marion cotillard  being a less than helpful saboteur  suffice to say that  when the mission finally gets under way  not everything goes according to planfilms as rich  multi layered and compelling as inception rarely come along  this film is full of intelligent ideas and questions about illusions and reality  much like the hugely under appreciated shutter island from earlier this year  which also starred dicaprio   however  it is also a riveting action thriller  with thrilling  jaw dropping action sequences and unforgettable images  think you ve seen all the visual effects  wait until you witness the iconic moment in which ariadne bends the paris cityscape on top of itself  think you re seen all the action sequences  wait until you devour the extraordinary zero gravity fight in a hotel corridor between arthur and an armed goon  this is majestic entertainment the tortured love story at its centre gives inception much needed heart  this is largely due to the exceptional performances of dicaprio and cotillard  dicaprio is effortless here  this is all the more impressive  as the whole film rests on his shoulders  if he goes down  so does the film  dicaprio never exaggerates his portrayal of a man who is carrying deep emotional scars  instead hinting at his pain through his expressions and body language  in a early sequence  whilst cobb is describing the business of mind defence to saito  he holds his arms and hands out like a box in front of him  this not only shows the prison of the mind which dom must break into  but also symbolises his own emotional entrapment  it is this kind of subtle behaviour which defines dicaprio s performance  it is also notable that he doesn t try to overshadow his co stars  this is another superlative piece of work from dicaprio  following his haunting performance in shutter island  cotillard  on the other hand  is the tragic heart of inception  beautiful and menacing at the same time  cotillard is gracefully strong in her role  she is a truly alluring presence  and together she and dicaprio bring an electrifying pulse of humanity to inception gordon levitt s brilliant  he brings great authority to his role and constantly gained my attention  also  he s rewarded with the zero gravity fight sequence  hardy is charming and bad ass  his bickering with gordon levitt is one of the film s highlights  page brings intelligence and wit to her role  at one point  she wonders out loud   whose subconscious are we in  exactly   ariadne is the audience  constantly wondering whether we are in reality or the dream world  watanabe is quietly dignified and cunning  we often wonder whether to trust saito  and watanabe seizes that ambiguity  cillian murphy brings a hitherto unseen emotional depth to his performance here as the target of the team  whilst rao also impresses  even michael caine and tom berenger appear in minor but pivotal roles  and both do great work  with berenger in particular succeeding in a tricky role technically  this is one of the most extraordinary films i have ever experienced  hans zimmer s mind blowing musical score and the wonderfully free  wide cinematography by wally pfister both give the film an epic scope which compliments the potential of dreams to transport us to a world beyond mundane reality  and what else can be said about the visual effects  they are mind bogglingly beautiful to behold  also  a big shout out to editor lee smith  especially in the last hour  where events in the different layers of the dream world are simultaneously playing out on screen  smith s editing gives the film perfect fluidity and immediacy  this film runs for around two and a half hours  and it moves like a bullet all the way to the conclusion inception s a visionary  muscular and mesmerising work of genius  with excellent performances  gorgeous imagery  heart pounding action  a terrific screenplay from nolan and his brother jonathan  a stunning score and intelligent discussions about the human mind and the pain that it sometimes struggles to abandon  the final shot s pitch perfect  questioning the fine line between what is perceived by the mind as reality and what is truly the real world  without going for the easy twist that one might expect  mr  nolan is far too clever for that  and he is too respectful of his

i have to admit   i did completely fall for the hype  given the complete secrecy surrounding christopher nolan s latest offering prior to its release  the extremely promising trailer  and the incredibly over the  top and fawning initial reviews  i really thought we had another the dark knight on our hands and now it feels like i have a rare disease   some infection of the senses that has prevented me from soaking in the supposed  awesomeness  that is inception  i don t know what the exact ratio is  but i think i m the one unlucky soul in every one thousand  that one lame boy who missed out on the land of dreams promised by the pied piper of cinema not that i didn t enjoy watching it at all   in fact  i went for it a second time  but mostly because there was so much of it that i didn t get the first time  the second viewing did help   as did the millions of plot theories available online that attempted to fill in the gaps   but  to borrow from that common  and dreaded  appraisal parlance  i really didn t get that wow effect some of the blame lies with my expectations   i was certainly expecting  aliens on  the moon from it  but i think it also has something to do with the fact that the film was way too focused on its myriad puzzles for me to feel any genuine connect  empathy  sympathy  hatred and or wonder  i m obviously thinking of you  heath ledger  rip   for any of its characters take dom cobb for example  for a man whose wife has committed suicide  implicated him for it  and penetrated his dreams to drive him almost to the edge of insanity   not to mention  seemingly  separated him from his kids forever   he seems remarkably in control  apart from the odd freight train crashing through his plans   so much so that when he hesitates to shoot mal at a critical point in the narrative  his indecision seem almost laughable  and extremely contrived  given how assured he is the rest of the time not that i d blame dicaprio for it   he s already won me over in a very similar role in the much more fascinating shutter island  where he gets his man on the edge act just right to create a really haunting portrayal  nopes  all that restraint is purely nolan s fault and then there s the bit about a film with 5 6 good guys   where the hell are all the bad guys dammit  how exactly do i feel that sense of fear  that sense of the stakes being really high  if all i can see is a bunch of gun toting dummies just waiting to be shot  heck  even the worst that can happen to these guys is only described in the vaguest of ways as being stuck in a  limbo    and then towards the end we re shown that it s possible to even retrieve people from such a state  which just makes me feel that i was cracking my head to figure out the danger for a good two hours for no reason whatsoever  and i don t like being made to feel that way even if i m totally wrong about the logic of this  i don t care   if i want to rack my brains out  i ll go take cat  instead of paying 500 bucks   200 for the food and popcorn courtesy my better half  to have my brains liquefied and oozing out of my nostrils  if not for the fascinating premise  and the genuinely innovative weightless sequence with joseph gordon levitt  and a really funny line from ken watanabe which i won t mention because it s the only bit of comic relief in the entire film   i might just have come away entirely disappointed and yes  while it may be true for the freight train  you have to be kidding me if you say you didn t see that end coming from miles away,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.0205865316092968, 'elapsed_time': 0.16451764106750488}",negative
"the most flawed thing that destroys the whole plot is the sick twisted wife 
why  because she clearly shows incredible self destructive delusions of grandeur  she is truly a maniac and really dangerous 
so the story doesnt work  if decaprio s character had notice these behaviours he would have left with the kids long time ago  and she would have been on heavy meds  on a psychiatric treatment

christopher nolan is a multifaceted person  again striking with his mind and views  a man with imagination  though the film didn t catch on except for the gorgeous special effects  the plot for such an idea is simple  the ending of the film is good  the casting is also  but about these dreams  here nolan is trying to confuse  but it doesn t work out  all these sleep inside a dream  the search is felt  it comes to such an extent that twice as many dreams turn out  a dream inside a dream inside a dream inside a dream  i hope i didn t confuse it  from the love line of leonardo dicaprio i liked the fact that in the end it became with his wife  as a character i liked her  but not an actress  with totems an interesting topic  but how other totems will act except for the top is not entirely clear  nolan s good work  but she is overrated,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9450085759162903, 'elapsed_time': 0.2020244598388672}",positive
this is a movie that definitely was majorly hyped as matrix meets james bond  it was neither  the plot is very confused and unless you want to start a chart be prepared to miss a few things here and there  one reviewer earlier said you have to watch it at least twice to understand it  really    a dream inside a dream inside another dream and inside yet another dream only to realize at the end the whole movie was a dream so it was yet another layer deep  please     just tell the story  a 2 hour plus movie that shows the same flashbacks again and again just to prove the the lead character is deeply mourning and hiding something  i swear if i saw the same cutaway scene of his 2 kids again i was going to scream the graphics are mediocre at best    cgi is cgi it s not new guys  just because you can bend a street      doesn t make it as ground breaking as matrix    whoopee  as for james bond     not really  a few gun battles and a grenade don t make you a james bond  besides james bond is based on a character who fights for queen and country     not to rip off a company for personal gains  at best these scenes are comparable to a first person shooter like battlefield the main character played by leo is the same character over and over from him  shutter island  the aviator  the island  etc is a deeply troubled character with secrets which end up cursing the main character to sacrifice  it s tried and boring from leo    branch out buddy    your not getting any younger overall  this was just not as hyped as a lot of movies are these days  a movie that is about 30 minutes longer than it should and with high priced talent which could have been performed better by lesser more able actors     i say save your  15 and wait a few months till its on hbo,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.023907838389277458, 'elapsed_time': 0.24032878875732422}",negative

as someone who loves movies that play with time and keep you guessing until the very end  i was absolutely blown away by inception  the movie follows the story of a team of people who specialize in entering dreams to extract information or plant ideas  but this time they are tasked with the challenge of implanting an idea in someone s mind instead of extracting one the director  christopher nolan  does a fantastic job of playing with time and making the audience question what is real and what is a dream  the use of different levels of dreams  each with their own timeline  creates a complex and intricate plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat the visuals in inception are breathtaking  and the special effects are used in a way that enhances the story rather than overpowering it  the rotating hallway scene  in particular  is a standout moment that showcases the creativity of the film s visual effects the cast  including leonardo dicaprio  joseph gordon levitt  and ellen page  deliver strong performances that bring depth to their characters and make the story even more engaging overall  inception is a masterpiece of a movie that not only entertains but also challenges the audience to think and question the nature of reality  christopher nolan s direction is masterful  and the film s unique approach to storytelling makes it an instant classic,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9977865219116211, 'elapsed_time': 0.21421408653259277}",positive

my wife and i fell for all the hype and went to this monstrosity of a film  i tried very hard to  get it   but my wife just fell asleep  i appreciate the objective of venturing into the wonders of dreamland  but i ve gone nighty night every night for nearly 63 years without anything remotely resembling any level of any of the dreams portrayed  my first problem with the film was the basic technical premise of one person being able to get inside another person s dreams  ok  i was willing to accept the concept on faith  but here you have a bunch of supposedly brilliant characters explaining it to each other  and their explanations lurched between  sophomoric  and  incoherent   then  accepting the dubious premises of the story  you have this idea that the dream compresses time as compared to reality  so the dream within the dream compresses time even further  and so forth  ok  i ll buy that  but the effect of this is that when we re two hours into the movie  suddenly everything is going very slowly  we watch that van falling imperceptibly toward the water  and although there s a lot of hyperkinetic action going on at the other levels  my wife is sound asleep and i m asking myself whether it will take all night for that damn van to hit the water so we can all go home  and while all this is going on  who within the story do we really care about  the dead wife  the cute chick who was supposed to be so smart  but just kind of sits there and doesn t do much as the plot unfolds  the rich guy whose brains are being used as an interstate freeway and shooting gallery for some other rich guy s advantage  leonardo  forget it  he s like captain ahab chasing the whale  but at least ahab had the good grace to go down to his death with the whale  the only ones i could empathize with were the two little kids  and they ve turned their back on their father  i don t blame them,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.015537862665951252, 'elapsed_time': 0.21048521995544434}",negative

inception no more explores dreams and the human mind than star wars explores outer space  inception is a rip off of the novel fireflies in the shadow of the sun  fss   published in 2004 but preceded by a web site on dreams  2001 2009   the thrust of which is about how dream experiences are the source of ideas and other changes to waking life  including personality development  the broader point is that like his character dom cobb  nolan himself steals the ideas he needs to create inception from a novelist and life long dream researcher chapter 7 titled  journey by deflection  occurs entirely in a shared dream in which 2 protagonists ascend   descend through  levels of dreaming  in action oriented sequences and even a  dream within a dream   addressing how intermittent awareness of the dreams affects the dream  but inception does not  a  intrigue   illuminate as to how these levels are distinct and yet intrinsically related or  b  draw from real dreams and real similarities to waking life  inception is just an action film set in dream space that neglects the essence of dreaming in dream symbolism  the dream space featured in inception is fictitious    a contrivance of both nolan and of the architect in nolan s story inception would have benefited by emulating fss in the one way it did not emulate it  in fss the characters trapped in the shared dream have to solve the dream s logic in order to wake up  this plot is much more conducive to an education of the language of dreams  which fss author spent an entire lifetime understanding from the time he started a diary of his own dreams at age 13 to his doctoral dissertation at age 27 exploring the relationship between dream experiences  coping strategies  blood chemistry  and symptoms in terminally ill cancer patients  like fss however  and this is yet another coincidental similarity between the two works  in inception the characters are thwarted by a dream that is plugged into their mental efforts to understand it  also as in fss  the dreamers have to deal with the denizens of a dream world that react to periodic episodes of lucid awareness of the dream  in fss  the whole script  including objects and aspects of the environment  respond to the awareness  but in inception we get the juvenile and scientifically ignorant development that other characters in the dream respond to dom cobb and his team like white blood cells to foreign pathogens  the bottom line is that fss teaches us things about dreams and inception will impress only the most psychologically unsophisticated among us or those who have never remembered a dream in their life also like fss  inception makes the point that much of the bizarreness of dreams is attributable to a higher order thinking  it does this using a statement very similar to one from the former fss web site  which maintained that while dreaming is a whole brain activity  the conscious person uses only about 3 5  of his or her brain  fss author remarks that experiencing and trying to make sense of a dream is like trying to fit 100  of something into 3 5  of itself    there will be distortion the subject matter notwithstanding  nolan s storytelling and direction are designed to give artificial weight to the real value of plot twists  in nolan we have a director who conceals and compensates for second rate thinking with cgi and high octane action that detracts from the story without getting the blood flowing  the action in the film was supposed to create a sense of time sensitive suspense  but came across more like the dull dishwater backing up in my sink than a raging river there are also inconsistencies in the film  nolan wants us to invest in the idea that everything that happens in a dream has an effect on the waking life of the dreamer  it works    until dom cobb dismisses out of hand his shooting of all these dream characters like they were throngs of disposable orcs or storm troopers  claiming its ok because they are  merely projections of the subconscious   suddenly  what happens in dream vegas stays in dream vegas  and where did the idea of  limbo  come from    introduced as a patchwork device for a poorly articulated plot and much of the film s premise is contradicted by real research which shows that the relationship between perceived and actual dream time is roughly 1 1,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7201654314994812, 'elapsed_time': 0.22743535041809082}",positive

everyone and his schnauzer is commenting on  inception   i ll chip in my two cent criticism as well i viewed this movie with my friends mark and ron at the amc theater in framingham on flutie pass  yes  named after doug   all of us came out stunned  ron thought it was the stupidest movie he had seen and mark opined that it was some really  f  ked up weird sh t   i tried to be more thoughtfully diplomatic by describing what i thought the movie was trying to do  basically  i thought  inception  tried to take the ancient themes of  what is reality  what is dream   and  is it all a dream  into convoluted  tiered  and entertaining directions i disagree with mr  ebert s assessment in his review that  inception  is  wholly original    inception  will remind you of many other movies  for example  it obviously evoked  dreamscape  and  the matrix   but did i  like  it  well  in past blogs i alluded to the concept of  cinematic dissonance   which i believe should be included in mr  ebert s movie glossary  by the way   a simultaneous experience where your intellect regards a film as garbage while your emotions regard the film as great fun  with  inception  i somewhat experienced the converse  my intellect appreciated the straight convoluted logic of the plot while my emotions simultaneously and eventually surrendered to impatience and boredom  in spite of the phantasmagoric special effects and intense action  well  it was late  and i am more of a morning person like other movies in the  dreams reality  genre   inception  sucks you into deciding which exciting  involved scenario is a dream or not  even when we are apparently  told  which one  this  trees at the expense of the forest  view is  i think  meant to be beside the point  like all good movies in this genre   inception  is saying that the basic idea to retain is  it s really all a dream  and  reality is a subjectively chosen point on a circular continuum   three scenes illustrate this  1  ariadne shows cobb the old  infinite mirror  phenomenon in the paris construct  2  cobb points out ariadne s circular maze is the proper architectural dream construct  and 3  the entire film s circular   this is where i came in  structure  inception  cleverly distracts us from this unsettling overall view with its noisy plot spinnings  the deceptive  3 dimensional chess  structure  recall ariadnee s choice of a bronze pawn as her  reality marker   of the putative idea planting plot  and the more emotionally involving dilemmas of fischer s and cobb s family issues  nolan also realizes that these distractions also make the potentially alienating and disquieting notion that nothing is truly real more entertainingly palatable  in other words  we arbitrarily choose cobb s and fischer s situations as the reality to which we want to cling  michael caine s character underscores that with his exhortation to cobb   come back to reality   making him  and not cobb s top  the actual arbitrary  reality marker  in other words  inception asks   at what point does the circle begin   even though the movie gives you an  answer   the real answer is  any point you choose   some would say  inception  demands repeated concentration  if you want to go on a metaphorical and symbological scavenger hunt  and there s nothing wrong with that   go right ahead  i don t think it s strictly necessary  one viewing is enough to tell you that life is but a dream p s   i think nolan wants you to be lulled into happy closure with cobb s  apparent reunion  with his children  the muted  static way that reunion scene is shot suggests otherwise   the dream shall never die   which i think would be a good title for the inevitable sequel,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9760667085647583, 'elapsed_time': 0.19701457023620605}",positive

when film makers make a movie that deals with the human subconscious like inception  they have millions of trinkets to play with  literally  the film makers own imagination is the limit inception does this very nicely  it creates rules for which the inception   planting an idea in someone s subconscious while they sleep  takes place  and tries to get the absolute most out of the story  action and graphics within the rules it created for itself for this inception to take place even though i found the movie very entertaining  in the end i felt a bit conned  this was because the movie kept telling me over and over again how brilliant it was  and how superbly complex it was  while in fact  it wasn t complex at all  the basic story is very simple actually  it s just made complex with a lot of gimmicks this isn t really a bad thing  all movies do it  so i wondered whether  feeling conned  is a good argument  i guess it mainly had to do with the ending of the movie  the ending is a cheap way to have your audience question whether it was real or not  of course  there is no correct answer  and that s ok  but why ask the question than  if it all wás real in end  the movie is that much better  now they choose to be oh so  deep  and  thoughtful   where yet again  it really is not i guess the  feeling conned  sentiment comes from all the  this movie is oh so complex  oh so deep  oh so thoughtful  gestures it makes  but it fails to deliver actual arguments  for me at least to back that claim up  the gimmicks are  needlessly  complex indeed  the basic story itself is not  not by a long shot this all sounds very negative  and the movie doesn t deserve it  it s a very good movie and to all the people i know i recommended watching it  mainly because it spawned interesting conversations  however  that bitter after taste of  feeling conned  has made me come to feel this is a movie without heart  to me it seems they didn t want to make this movie so  complex  and  deep  because they loved doing so or because the story deserved it  they only did it to try and trick me to think this was a brilliant movie  and when you try to do that with me  i tend to back away all in all  a very good movie  which left a cheesy after taste  but at least it was a lot better than the dark knight  the directors previous blockbuster  which i found horrendously bad  and over hyped   so  final verdict  7 it would have been 1 or 2 points higher if the movie had more heart  a lame argument i know  but i don t know how else to put in words,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8945150971412659, 'elapsed_time': 0.21598410606384277}",positive
inception is a relatively simple story made complex by the way that it is told  in that respect it is unsurprising that it was conceived at the same time that christopher nolan was making his breakthrough project memento  again a simple story rendered complex by its presentationspoilerinception is about an attempt to insert an idea into the conscious mind of a dreaming subject in such a way as to make him believe that the idea is his own or originated from his own subconscious  this is the titular  inception   the subject is cillian murphy  heir to a vast corporate empire which is close to achieving a monopoly of power generation  the idea to be implanted is that he should break up his father s corporate empire  the prime motivator is businessman saito  ken watanabe  who hires ideas thief dom  leonardo dicaprio  after the latter botches an attempt at extracting information from saito s own dreams dom assembles a team comprising an architect who will design the dream spaces  ellen page   someone who can impersonate others in dreams  tom hardy  and a drug specialist who can keep them under long enough to achieve their goal  along for the ride is dom s long suffering partner in crime arthur  joseph gordon levitt  and saito himself  whether the scheme succeeds and how the story plays out i will leave to the viewer to discover end spoilermuch of the film revolves around explaining the process of entering and monkeying with people s dreams  in this nolan is clever as dreams are a universal shared human experience  thus the sensation of falling which often wakes people becomes a core element of the process of stepping up out of dreams and seems entirely convincing  whilst we know that this is fantasy it has that crucial ring of believability to it and obeys its own laws so far as the requirements of narrative and suspense allow i suspect that people who have seen this film will fall into three categories  males aged 14   21 will probably treat this film as a religious experience  ascribing it with all manner of  important  philosophical  truths   males who were 14   21 in 1999 will  i suspect  hate it   accusing it of being a rip off of the  masterpiece  of their generation  the matrix  anyone else will probably see it  enjoy it and then forget it  i suspect that there is a pseudo  philosophical action film for every generation and this is simply the latest for all that  inception is an enjoyable film  it is roughly 43  as intelligent as it thinks it is but it is well crafted  nicely filmed and excellently acted leonardo dicaprio seems to have built a career out of playing damaged people with dark secrets in their past  his characters in shutter island  blood diamond  the departed and  in fact  just about everything he has done in the last decade or so  but he is reliably good at it and is so here  joseph gordon levitt is brilliant as always  although sadly relegated to a side role  ellen page is good but her character simply exists to have the mechanics of the world explained to her and the audience  thus she has little chance to shine  the show stealer is tom hardy who has almost all of the film s funny lines and all but one of the funny moments the special effects are impressive but restrained  as with the best films they support the story rather than become the point of it the weakest element is the plot which is very simple but then maybe it needs to be  with the added confusion of different layers of reality intermingling anything more complex would have required that moviegoers be handed a flowchart on leaving the cinema  which would have been very welcome in the case of 2004 s primer http   xkcd com 657 large   in closing i d like to add my own slant to the debate as to the closing scene  it strikes me that what is important is not whether it falls but the fact that dom doesn t care if it does or doesn t  perhaps the message is that reality is what we decide it is,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9901939630508423, 'elapsed_time': 0.2286694049835205}",positive

i have a pretty high standard when it comes to the re interpretation of dreams  or the workings of the mind in general  by filmmakers which is likely due to the fact that i myself am a dreamer  there is nothing more irksome than these half conceived  mostly contrived dalliances that are gobbled up by the ever passive viewing public as if they were shedding a bright light on the subject  i could go on about how not one of the characters is developed enough to overcome the films main flaw of not being like a dream or how nolan couldn t seem to make up his mind which movie to make  the more psychologically gripping tale of multiple lives lived in an endless cascade of dreams or the non stop  high octane espionage tale which would have been super fun if it had actually taken place in a dream  but keepin  it real  the action sequences we did see were pretty standard   i won t  however  because i can t let go of the glaring inadequacies of mr  nolan s literal  linear  unimaginative  and perhaps disinterested efforts to delve into the dream world proper while walking out of the theater  i got into a quick chat with another member of the audience  i stated that   in the main the film was predictable  and he replied   i think it was supposed to be   really  since when are dreams predictable  mein gott  we re getting soft  people  we re not supposed to walk out of a movie concerned with this both known and unknowable subject matter rock steady  on the contrary  we should all be wearing deeply puzzled yet deeply satisfied looks on our faces as though we d been led across some great gulf and left there to work our own way back the takeaway message here is that it takes more than the latest cgi to deliver a reasonable simulacrum of the sub conscience  and for the proof of that remark one need only look at the work of michel gondry and of the master  david lynch  your mind will reel indefinitely,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.12609678506851196, 'elapsed_time': 0.1514875888824463}",negative

inception nolans latest effort is a cleverly constructed and beautifully executed sci fi thriller  apparently he first pitched the idea to wb in 2003 and then went away to write a script he thought would be finished in a few months  8 years later the film is released and it s no wonder it took so long to complete the film follows cobb  leonadro di caprio   who specialises in entering people s dreams and stealing valuable secrets his employers  we open with cobb in the mind of saito ken watanabe   a business tycoon he needs to retrieve secret documents from  but things go horribly wrong when the subconscious projection of his former wife enters the dream and betrays him  cobb and his partner arthur  joseph gordon levitt  are forced to flee the country as their employers will not tolerate failure  but saito tracks them down and makes them an offer  inception  if they can successfully plant an idea into the mind of one of saitos competitors saito will pull the strings necessary to grant cobb the freedom to go back to america and see his kids again cobbs team is consists of arthur  yusuf the chemist  dileep rao   eames  tom hardy   adriadne the architect  ellen page  who is responsible for creating the dream  nolan not only manages to create a wonderful story  but also adds his own cyberpunk dialogue to the mix   riding the kick    totems    projections   they all add substance to the world he has created  the origins of this technology are not explored  in fact it s more of an alternate reality than a story set in the future  but it s a world constructed with such attention to detail that it feels real what follows is a complex but not overly contrived series of dreams within dreams in order to plant the idea deep enough for it to stick  it s a mixture of theft and business espionage that provides a setting for some wonderful visuals  and in the end the only limitation is the mind of nolan himself  one scene where arthur is fighting off the projections of the target inside a rotating corridor is thrilling to watch in all its nauseating vertigo  whilst cobbs training of adriadne provide the artistic license to pull a whole host of crazy special effects  cities bend in half  mirrors smash and turn into streets  it s a world of unlimited potential di caprio once again proves that he knows how to pick a movie  his scorsese partnership rarely disappoints  but nolan has provided the platform for another successful performance  joseph gordon levitt is able to play his role with both suave coolness and perfectly timed comedic relief  whilst ellen page uses her indie image to convey a female lead devoid of the usual stereotypes  the rest of the supporting cast all do a fine job  especially cillian murphy as the mind invaded and emotionally manipulated target of the inception after watching this film i m still convinced nolan boasts a flawless oeuvre  every one demonstrates a clear talent for script writing  insomnia may be the weakest of them all and it will come as no surprise it s the only film he had no hand in writing in  nolan however could not resist one final teaser to the audience with inception  as the film concludes and we are left satisfied with the arc of our protagonist  the camera pans away on to the perpetually spinning totem  as it is about to topple the film cuts away  now i don t think nolan is seriously trying to imply that cobb is dreaming  instead i think it s his own clever inception  to plant an idea into the minds of the audience and watch it grow,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9866846203804016, 'elapsed_time': 0.13364386558532715}",positive

a corporate billionaire wants to eliminate his competition by implanting an idea in the subconscious of the man who stands to inherit the fortune  that he should dismantle the company into smaller entities  he hires cobb  dicaprio  to do this  who enlists a team  they tether together in dreams through a low tech contraption that is never explained  which also puts them to sleep instantly to implant this idea in the man s mind  they have to go very deep  a dream within a dream  within a dream  within a dream  down three layers  in each successive layer time speeds up so that hours in layer three is a few minutes in layer two  and seconds in layer one  to go three layers deep they need to take a sedative that is specially designed to deaden everything but the inner ear  so that the feeling of free fall  called a kick  will cause the subject to wake up  but one catch  using the sedative  if they die in the dream  their mind goes to  limbo  in real life  apparently a coma like state they need about 10 hours to accomplish their task  luckily for them  the target  the billionaire s son  takes a plane from paris to la regularly  and the flight is 10 hours  arrangements are made so the private jet has mechanical problems forcing the target to take a commercial jet  to ensure they won t be disturbed in first class  the billionaire who hatched this plan buys the airline  because it seemed neater  the dreamers carry their own talisman that reveals to the dreamer if they are awake or dreaming  cobb has a small top that spins infinitely while dreaming  but in waking state it eventually topples   how the other talismans work is never explained  arthur has a loaded dye and the girl makes a chess like piece  we never see them use theirs to check their state of reality  but cobb uses his twice  the details of how lucid dreaming works is conveniently concocted for the film  one of the dreamers constructs a world in the form of a maze for everyone else to use as the dreamscape  the subconscious mind of the target fills the landscape with their unguarded thoughts  allowing someone to steal their thoughts  or plant a thought   a dreamer can also introduce fears and guilt into the landscape which materialize as threats  buildings crumbling  etc cobb doesn t tell his team that he is deeply conflicted about planting a thought  inception  in his wife s mind  which was to question her reality  he did this while they lucid dreamed together  which became an addiction  gradually revealed throughout the film as backstory  she finally jumped out a window to kill herself and wanted him to commit suicide with her  so before she jumped  she sent a letter to her lawyer saying her husband wanted her dead  knowing he would get blamed for her suicidal jump  he fled the country to paris and the entire movie takes place abroad  his drive to help the billionaire is a promised call  to the right people  that will allow him to return home to be reunited with his two children  cobb s guilty subconscious kept bringing his dead wife into the dreamscapes where she tries to kill others the dream sequences themselves are long  drawn out  convoluted  and often boring  they try to distract you from this by having constant gunfire from  projections  that are nearly always attacking the main characters  the villain of the movie was psychological  cobb s inner struggle  that was a major weakness because there was nothing to root against  and you don t care about the main objective either  the billionaire s plan    in fact the target is a more appealing character than anyone else in the film  so the only reason to sit through the entire movie is to see if cobb gets to go home in the end  and frankly it takes the entire movie  if you don t walk out  to care about that too  and by then the only reason you care is b c you sat through 2 5 hrs to see how it ends the best scene  dramatically  is when they wake on the plane and each look at one another after going through so much   2hrs worth   in dream state  the billionaire makes a phone call as the plane lands in la  and cobb clears customs  he is met by his father  or his ex wife s father   who takes him home  cobb walks into the house  sees his children playing outside  as we have seen in many sequences throughout the movie  but this time he calls their names  and they turn around and look at him  at the same time he drops his bags  and as a last action  takes out his talisman and spins in on the table  then rushes to greet his kids  we hold on it in foreground while he picks up his children in background     zooming in on the spinning talisman until it occupies the entire screen     spinning  spinning spinning     it starts to wobble ever so slightly    and cut to black  leaving viewers unsure if cobb was still dreaming the ending was good and there were two other noteworthy scenes  one is a fight scene in zero gravity in dream layer two  and another was in the movie trailer  the dreamscape curling in on itself to form a cube unfortunately  i didn t care about any of the characters nor was there any emotional investment in the main plot  who cares if a billionaire gets his competition to breakdown his empire  and i also didn t care much if cobb was reunited with his kids  as there is one lone scene of a phone call he makes to them that is supposed to establish our emotional investment  and it fell way short of doing that  finally  as previously stated  there is no villain except for cobb s guilt over his wife s death  i struggled to sit through this

i will say there were some amazing special effects  and action scenes  but overall   inception  left me bored  this is most likely due to the fact that the movie is close to nothing but 3 hours of fending off enemies that are nothing but nameless faceless  white blood cells  defending the subconscious  it just felt like it dragged on forever  that along with the fact that i felt zero attachment to the characters in the movie and an overly ridged dreamscapes made this film feel horridly sterile  not to mention  the film felt very jumpy  as in it jumps from scene to scene to scene every few minutes  in fact  the film may have been trying to pull off a feat so grand  that it leaves you thinking its all just a big jumbled mess not worth the frustration of following  i can deal with a complex film  but i feel that the jumping around to all the scenes occurring simultaneously made the film lose focus  in other words  i watched the movie play out  but it did not pull me into it  i was a detached viewer  no emotional involvement whatsoever  on top of that  the film was honestly very predictable and had very little in the revelation department  you could always see the tracks before the train went over them so to speak  one aspect of the movie that just completely dumbfounded me was that the film managed to be both imaginative  yet uncreative at the same time  there is so much potential for creativity in a movie about dreaming  but this film decided to make the dreams seem more like virtual reality then actual dreams however  the biggest disappointment of this movie is the fact that everyone claimed it was an intelligent thinking mans film  this film has not exercised one bit of critical thinking in my mind  it feels overly superficial and hardly a film that can spark deep philosophical debate  after watching  inception  it did not have me contemplating the big questions in life one bit  when it ended  it ended  and that was that,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.008938183076679707, 'elapsed_time': 0.154754638671875}",negative

it is probably just me since movies like the matrix bore me to tears but i literally could barely stay awake during this nonsense  i am quickly coming to the conclusion that the leonardo di caprio school of acting involves simply glowering and clenching his jaw during every scene  if you loved the matrix you will probably like this but if you found the matrix to be as boring as i did then you may want to avoid losing two hours of your life on this  some of the computer graphics were compelling but this is strictly the matrix from a different perspective and just as uninteresting  go rent fargo or some other decent movie and avoid wasting your time on this nonsense,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.0023627227637916803, 'elapsed_time': 0.13334918022155762}",negative

this movie seemed like it was going to be a different and original  but it became so convoluted to the point that the main goal or focus of the movie was lost in the shuffle  sure the visuals were interesting at times  but the buildup  background  preparation and complexity of drilling down into different sleep levels diluted character development or any interest in what the characters were trying to achieve the movie was out of balance in so many ways  cobb presumably had the ability and resources to fly around the world and manage small tactical assault teams  but could not arrange to meet his kids somewhere  fischer just buys in to whatever cobb is selling and goes along participating in deeper levels  hundreds  if not thousands of bullets fired and only one character gets hit  how much film time was given to the backs of two kids or the falling van leo was okay with what he was given to work with  but ellen page was miscast and was terrible  the script and storyline could have been much tighter and the combined effort of all resulted in a ho hum  bad remix of avatar  mission impossible and the matrix  maybe the video game will be better,"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.005928725469857454, 'elapsed_time': 0.14013290405273438}",negative

my summary is not meant to infer this film is so complex that you have to be a genius on some level to understand it  what it means is that nolan has crafted a film which has so many layers going on that you inevitably miss a piece of detail from one of those layers and it is only through subsequent viewings that you are able to fully appreciate the film camereon touted avatar as a film created for the cinema experience and he successfully did that  it is a film which seen in a smaller format does no justice  so too is nolan s film created for a specific experience  that of multiple viewings and group discussion  this is a film that you have to discuss with other people  you have to see multiple times as it is a sensory overload  this is a film which truly is a personal and group experience all in one the story is not that complex in its genesis  it is a heist film  but whereas most heist films are after an object  this one is about taking over someones subconscious and planting something  not taking anything  though it could be said they are taking away free will  you have a group of people led by decaprio s character  all specialists in a certain area  working for the common goal  however in this story  ultimately  decaprio s character is working for a very singular goal  to get back home  to achieve a certain level of redemption the film works on many levels in a very literal sense  you must be paying attention to know what level you are in  this is a simple heist movie  but nolan takes that seed and creates a world of opened and closed levels  in the amongst the goal of the group there are trials and tribulations  ultimately  all of those trials are a product of what each team member brings to the heist  when you are dealing with dreams  the subconscious plays a huge role  how messed up your subconscious is determines just how deep the rabbit hole is that you are about to go down that is all i will say about the film s story  you must experience this for yourself with as little upfront info as possible  suffice to say performances are fantastic  there is no one person to single out  it is a complete ensemble cast  effects are crazy  would love to see film in an imax environment  as good as they are  they only serve the story  not the other way around  finally the music is some of zimmerman s best work to date  he tends to create many of the same signature notes but this go around he has created a score that is as complex and on as many levels as the film get out and see this film  enjoy it  talk about it with your friends and see it again,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9975107312202454, 'elapsed_time': 0.13573145866394043}",positive

the word  inception  will always be associated with this 2 5 hour movie we have here and that says it all basically about how defining the outcome is  but first things first  the writer and direcctor here is of course christopher nolan and his british american production from 2010 is maybe still his defining effort ten years later  they are showing this in theaters now again for said tenth anniversary and i happily took the chance to give it another watch  my third in fact and it definitely was not worse than my first or second  this is the kind of film that is indeed a lot better to be seen on the big screen  not only  but also because of the special effects  this movie won four oscars  so also a big success with awards bodies  especially because it took home 150 more awards and over 200 more nominations and that is just what is listed here on imdb  still i remember many people outraged back then because the one thing it did not get was an oscar nomination for nolan himself as director despite getting in at pretty much every important precursor  however  now in 2020  he also has his director nod and for this film here he got the writing nomination at least and that is absolutely alright because i think that the writing is the film s best aspect probably  utter genius involved here and even more impressive if it was nolan all on his own apparently no oscar nominations for the cast here  i think the only one who was slightly considered was marion cotillard and i would have liked it  she was really good  but then again i am a fan of her anyway  but it wasn t meant to happen and that is perfectly fine  she has one trophy already anyway  also did back then  which maybe helped her also in terms of getting cast here  she is one of several cast members that have worked with nolan on other occasions before or after this movie  even if i think her portrayal in the final batman film did not receive such positive acclaim overall  oh well  others would be murphy  hardy and of course michael caine  who only has very little screen time here  two scenes and his second scene only lasts for a few seconds  but the first is really nice when his character meets the protagonist  then there s a few actors whose star has gone down a bit in the last 10 years since this movie was made  murphy may fit the description too to some extent  but i mostly mean the younger folks like joseph gordon levitt and ellen page  and pete postlethwaite is already dead for a few years  a bit sad knowing that now with how we see his character here dying too  may he rest in peace  but speaking of jgl  his role here is a bit of an example why he would never make it big in hollywood  his character so plays second fiddle to leonardo dicaprio that it was a bit embarrassing almost here and there and among the weaker components of the film  take the very early part already how he is trying so hard to convince watanabe s character  while leo knows his value and is all smooth and cool  or how jgl is the one being caught and used to put pressure on cobb  leo  and even gets a bullet in the head  or how he falls from the chair  kicked by hardy i think  to elaborate on another phenomenon how people wake up from dreams  oh yes  watanabe i mentioned  him i liked and like in general as an actor  i wish his character could have had more screen time to be honest  but his injury got in the way  but as we were sliding down the spheres  he gets better again  still a bit strange how he so effortlessly turns into good guy and part of the team while being the antagonist before that and also with no real knowledge on the subject accompanies the thieves in their crucial endeavor involving murphy s character  he was not really needed though another character who becomes part of the gang is ellen page s  she had some good moments and some not so good moments  definitely not on par with the one other significant female character here  namely cotillard s  but overall she is alright  the conscience scene with the  people  looking at her with angry faces is among the most memorable of the entire film  how she pushes these huge mirrors in position to show us the concept of going deeper and deeper into the mind  layer by layer  was also really good  but the idea that she really joins the gang too is already difficult to believe  but her return and talk about utter creation make me almost forget about it  what i cannot forget  however  is her final idea to step down to the bottom layer where watanabe s character is lost  they acted as if this layer was simply too tough to take and then minutes later they are like okay well no biggie  let s go there and fix everything  the real final antagonist  namely hal  cotillard   waiting there alone sure cannot justify their initial thoughts about that layer and its impact  as for cotillard s character  of course the french music was a pretty telling inclusion again linked to her previous oscar winning movie for sure  everybody who saw that one  must have made the connection  anyway  speaking of page s character again  kinda telling that she gets an implied romantic relationship with the kiss moment between her character and jgl s  that was one of the very few funny moments and that is fine  it was okay  but no need to stretch it or turn it into a romance movie  nolan has many other  bigger strengths and i am glad he focused on these also in my showing  some people laughed at everything they got the chance to laugh at  it was pretty embarrassing  they knew nothing about movie quality  anyway  nolan s biggest strength here is the attention to detail  as good as the overall concept may be  the best thing is what he did with these small moments  such as the carpet having the wrong material and we realize it is just a dream within a dream  there are many other examples  such as everything involving hardy s character too  he also brought in some comedy  like when he is that lady or when he guns down the enemy and tells jgl s character to think big  but the overall concept is just as good  the idea of how being killed in a dream makes you wake up  all the layers  or the idea how we do not remember the beginning of a dream  how did the two get there   and a lot more  nolan s script really oozes brilliance and creativity here and i would have been totally fine with it winning a fifth oscar  or even with the film winning best picture  which it admittedly never had a shot at  but the concept of dreaming and how little we and science know about it now in the 21st century is something that has fascinated me for a long time really  especially because i am a very heavy and intense dreamer myself  so exactly my cup of tea this movie and maybe people with little interest in the overall idea will like it less  or maybe not  if we take a look at the really high rating here on imdb and this really high ranking up in the top250  not undeserving  nolan created a world of genius at the same time  away from all the sci fi  he also managed to create a touching story between cobb and hal  the scene when she jumps down from the roof is of course especially haunting  but also how we never see their children s faces in the dream because cobb refuses to until he sees them in reality  and does so in the end  happy end  maybe  but to me it all felt so rushed with how he meets the old self of watanabe s character  by the way the quote about how he simply bought the airline was another great comedic moment  maybe nolan is not as bad as i thought and should finally make a 100  comedy movie   turns him into a young man again within seconds and they all wake up inside the plane and even murphy s character makes his peace again with his old man  and finally cobb can  thanks to the asian s help  get back to america and see his kids and then we see the swirling totem  hal s totem  does that mean we are indeed in her dream still  it could be with nolan poking fun at unrealistic  in the truest sense of the word  rushed endings and nothing we saw was reality  was hal right all along  that s the good thing here  there is no 100  right or wrong  no 100  true or false and even if you watch this film ten times  you will still find something new you have not come across before  something new that can help you develop new creative approaches to the film and the reality depicted therein  also have you ever asked yourself if you are in a dream yourself because when you are dreaming  then you usually don t know  so who says it couldn t be one we are all in right now  anyway  this should be almost enough now with the review  you hopefully understood how much i liked this film just a few more snippets of information  2010 was an amazing year for dicaprio because he also appeared in scorsese s  shutter island   another brilliant movie about the distorted human mind  i just mentioned the idea of totems  that i like as well  also with the additional idea that you should not let anybody touch your totem and how cobb puts page s character to a bit of a test there  oh yes  another really smart reference the 1 10 proportion  one hour of dreaming equals ten hours of action in our dreams  which is why reality got slower and slower the further they dove down and how they showed it to us with the car crashing down the cliff  another happy ending that they are all saved  in fragments of 10  of a second maybe with all that has been going on underneath in the meantime was another stroke of genius for sure  there is so much to like here  it is pretty unreal  i am generally not a huge action film fan  but the very action packed sequence in the icy region was good too  what can i say  i just like snow  even if they had preferred an island in the sun or so  another comedic moment  alright  i think i ll leave it at that  even if there are another dozen moments at least so full of wit and creativity  just like myself  that they deserve elaboration on  but i won t because you need to watch it yourself instead,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9867860674858093, 'elapsed_time': 0.1381244659423828}",positive

many people may think  why to write the 1254th review of the same film  well  because something is needed to be pointed out  inception is not paprika  i ve seen both films recently   inception  just yesterday  and its plot is completely different  yes  they share the aspect that one person can enter someone else s dream  paprika s spoiler  and even shared dreams to an extent  but the development  the goals of the characters  the scenarios  not just the look  but its use  and the plot are completely different  we re facing two films with their respective strengths and weaknesses  i think there s so few left to speak about inception  but to say that everything on it was carefully designed and filmed  it s definitely the work of a genius that will stand a top with others sci fi genre classics  keep up the great work mr  nolan  you re from now  my favorite director,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9752163887023926, 'elapsed_time': 0.13191890716552734}",positive
"my personal all time favorite movie everything about this movie is so perfect  the acting  the plotline  the idea behind the plot  the action  the emotion  the adrenaline  the soundtrack  the look  such a beautifully well crafted movie that i keep understanding new things each time i rewatch it  i personally am more of an action kind of movie watcher so keep that bias in mind 
the movie admittedly is difficult to understand the first time you watch it  but is still quite enjoyable  but i love how the movie gets more enjoyable as you rewatch it  there are so many movies that i m like  eh  watched it  solid  wouldn t really care to watch again  but this movie isn t made up of the  movie junk food  that s in most movies","{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9933725595474243, 'elapsed_time': 0.14011836051940918}",positive

the most important thing i adore about hollywood movies is that they never die out of ideas  inception is no exception  the concept presented in inception is very unique and refreshing  and it s not only the idea but how christopher nolan has presented it was epitome of direction  though the story is very complicated and everything is happening in hustle and bustle but still you are glued to your seats  the way movie unrolls it self is immaculate work of a class director  all the cast did justice to their roles  leonardo dicaprio was very convincing as guilty stricken husband and desperate father to meet his children again  i had never doubted the capabilities of leonardo and he didn t disappoint me  oscar veteran marion cotillard was very promising as perplexed wife who was the first victim of inception  i think inception is one of the finest works by nolan till now,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.994094967842102, 'elapsed_time': 0.1412215232849121}",positive

let me just say that first and foremost i am a christopher nolan fan  i watched the following and memento over and over again  in his new movie  inception he has a love story with no love  this is the biggest piece missing in the puzzle  the trailer convinced the moviegoer that this movie was about a guy who goes into people s dreams and steal secrets  that is not what this movie is about  in fact  there are giant holes in the set up  he did a few cardinal sins as a writer  for example  he set up rules for his world and then broke them  the movie is interesting and ground breaking with the action and effects but in the end you don t care about the characters  in the end  with all the dizzying effects and cut backs all you have is a lost like ending  i hated lost because ultimately they didn t know how it was going to end  and i think for christopher nolan he fell victim to this same fate,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8898688554763794, 'elapsed_time': 0.14974761009216309}",positive
i ve seen inception for several times now  and while i understand the plot and what s going on better i also find it dragging slightly during it s final hour  with that i mean the action scenes  or dream scenes the movie and what is to come is introduced nicely  in the beginning we have already multiple dream layers and the lead characters  dom  arthur  saito and mal  who is very important character even if not real   mal can be described as the movie s antagonist  because she lives in dom s dreams and subconscious and can appear anywhere in the dream  she acts as an variable in the already highly fragile dream scenes and is the only scary aspect of the film  not because mal is scary in her presence  she must have been lovely  but because her reflection resembles dom s bitterness and remorse dom cobb is played brilliantly by leonardo dicaprio  ken watanabe is great as saito  and cillian myrphy is pretty good in the role of a large corporation s young and insecure ceo  all the rest seemed ok  the biggest treat of the film are the visuals  or cgi  you either like or hate the dream scenes since they seem very empty and sterile which i think is the intention  because they are designed a task in mind by a human  an architect  to be effective and much like labyrinths  a shape i didn t notice elsewhere but in the hotel scene   the  heist   so to speak  happens in these dream scenes  or layers  that remind me a lot like first person shooter battle arenas  these scenes propably won t amaze anyone by their design  the visual effects on the other hand are very clever and huge inception bends the borders of reality and makes you think if a dream space is more real and acceptable than reality  which is why mal killed herself to escape from reality  she was wrong doing so  and dom can t get over it and blames himself  that s why dom recreates mal from his memory to meet her in his own dream space and to settle with her  ariadne is the only person who really understands the danger in that  but they still blunder into very risky mission  where of course everything goes wrong the biggest problem for me in inception  which is otherwise highly entertaining and clever film  are the generic james bond action scenes  that don t feel very dream like and at the same time are not real either  i didn t sense any danger during them  because the characters can t die  additionally  the time line appears warped while the van is falling from bridge  since it seems to take forever  and the loud music doesn t really help in creating suspense but instead irritates you and feels forced the meaning of  kick  seemed to alter during the film  at first it wakes you up when free falling  later it only works during impact  weird  maybe it s because of the highly effective drug they used in the final mission and the kick must being synchronized  or whatever that s probably nitpicking  because i value the bold effort from nolan  the script must have been pain to write because of it s complexity  but he managed to execute it brilliantly  i think inception is 2010 s matrix and probably his best film,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9946924448013306, 'elapsed_time': 0.14560270309448242}",positive
i went into the multiplex to watch this movie without much expectation  i had seen all the trailers  but they did not really give away much of what i was going to see  in my opinion  when the credits started rolling  i was amazed  this is the best movie i ve seen in the past 2 years  the last time i had so much to say about a movie was when i saw nolan s  dark knight  first of all the opening is top notch  it builds up the suspense  and smoothly moves on to introducing dicaprio s character to the audience  dicaprio shows us the first  mind heist  of the movie  his character cobb feels the need to go home  and stealing others  ideas so that he can buy his way back to the us  it is revealed that he committed a crime in france  so he has not had the misfortune of being extradited cobb gets a job from saito  watanabe  to get into fisher s  cilian murphy  mind and steal an idea  to do so  cobb needs to build the dream world  for which he hires an architect ariadne  ellen page   cobb has secrets of his own  which are revealed in the lower levels of his mind  so to speak  he searches for a sedative that can enable him to create a dream within a dream within a dream  to keep track of reality  he keeps a top  if the top topples  he is in the real world cobb is supported by an excellent supporting cast  joseph gordon levitt and tom hardy are excellent accomplices in his mind crimes  michael caine too gets some screen time  mal  marion cotillard  is an impressive shade  the memory which keeps killing all other  projections   which is the dream representation of the real world character  cobb is constantly seeking ways to assuage his guilt of being partially responsible for mal s death  it was because of him that she lost the ability to distinguish between dreams and reality  constantly seeking  the kick    the feeling of falling that jolts one out of her dream after the heist is over  cobb is seen going back to the us  clearing immigration without being arrested  he spins the top on the table  which never really topples by the time the credits roll  perhaps reality was never good enough for cobb  and he has chosen to live in a dream forever until his brain is reduced to mush  perhaps he did go home  the viewer is left wondering  bringing this brilliant movie to an end,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9894976019859314, 'elapsed_time': 0.14428377151489258}",positive
this is the second time around that i ve seen inception  the first time around was about 3 years ago  and back then it was just for the sake of watching all the best movies on imdb  i did not understand it then  and i do not fully understand the end quarter of the film still  but what i can say is it s for sure a beautiful film throughout  i am a big fan of the ending  with it being a subtle cliffhanger that is not the usual cliche type and takes the film back to the very beginning and reminds of all again of the purpose of cobbs misson  it s even a bit emotional  the only real complaint i have is i would have liked to know how this method of breaking into peoples minds and dreams works  all in all a fantastic rewatch and definitley saves itself,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9920936822891235, 'elapsed_time': 0.13830995559692383}",positive

"visually  inception is rich  although some images tend to become repetitive in this overlong film 
it boasts a star laden cast  di caprio  hardy  cotillard  caine  postlethwaite  and many other greats in small roles  yet  there is not a single great piece of acting in it 
the script is full of twists  play on the third dimension  time  and all kinds of theories  but in the end    it has no idea how to end  it goes on and on  mostly in slow motion 
what was the secret sought in the vault  was  disappointed  a synonym for citizen kane s  rosebud

overall  the film was excellent   the storyline with cobb s wife was handled particularly well there were some minor issues though  primarily  why weren t they in freefall at the start of level 3  in the snow   since the freefall in level 1 caused them to be in freefall in level 2 and yet this didn t carry on through to level 3  this could have been due to the time delay between the dreams  but all the other effects occurred simultaneously and it caused the avalanche so that didn t really make sense to me  what makes this particularly disappointing is that it could be easily then  fixed  by arthur putting them in the elevator to create artificial gravity   i think it would have been a good addition to the film and highlighted the dependence they had on each other when cobb returned to the older saito  i was expecting that to go as the start of the film did  in a twelve monkey style twist where the entire film was all in cobb s mind as he became insane in limbo  i m glad they avoided the clichéd ending here though reading other reviews on the internet  i have found some very interesting ideas  such as the children s faces being cobb s real totem  and the spintop being his wife s  and so when he saw his children he knew he was not in someone else s dream  though he could still be in his own  i m also surprised they didn t play with the idea of cobb just being a projection in someone else s dream and so not really existing at all and the dream being his reality in a blade runner esquire twist  i think that this may have been a more interesting ending though i m not sure how to implement it subtly overall an excellent film  though there were so many unexplored ideas  i think a sequel could work well if they handle it carefully,"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9907429814338684, 'elapsed_time': 0.1408238410949707}",positive
